From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Three aspirants are jostling for the vacant governorship candidate position of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Abia State. They are Eric Opah, Okey Ahiwe and Bob Nwogu, all from Isiala Ngwa North LGA. The position became vacant following the death of erstwhile candidate, Prof. Uche Ikonne on January 25. Following his death, the PDP caucus in Abia State met and micro zoned the position to Ikonne’s Isiala Ngwa North Local Government Area as a mark of respect. Despite agitations from two former aspirants, the party threw the contest open for aspirants from the LGA citing the new electoral law. The timetable released by the national body of the party indicated that a fresh primary would be held tomorrow, February 4, at Umuahia Township Stadium, to choose a replacement for Ikonne. Among the candidates is Opah,  founder of Fortune Global Shipping and Logistics Limited and Fortune Marine and Energy Services Limited. He is  a chieftain of the PDP and hails from Mbubo, in Isiala Ngwa North LGA.   Another frontrunner is Okey Ahiwe, who is Chief of Staff (CoS) to Governor Okezie Ikpeazu. Ahiwe hails from Umuire Village in Eziama Ntigha Autonomous Community of Isiala-Ngwa North LGA. The third is Bob Ogu, a lawyer and former Commissioner for Works in the state who also  hails from Isiala North LGA.
