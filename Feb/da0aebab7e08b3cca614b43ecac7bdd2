It was a major boost for the Labour Party (LP) at the weekend in Cross River State as the All Progressives Congress (APC) heavyweight in the state, Senator M. T. Mbu (Jr), dumped the party and declared for the LP. Senator Mbu, who was the Unifier-in-Chief for the crisis-ridden APC in the state and was the architect of Governor Ben Ayade leaving PDP for APC, said that he is now Obidient. The Obi-Datti Media, which disclosed this in a statement, said Senate Mbu said he was joining the Obidient movement because it’s becoming very obvious that they are the only ones who can restore the much-needed peace, unity, and progress in Nigeria. The distinguished Senator also believes that the Obi-Datti team is the only one that can restore a bright future for the Nigerian youths who are indeed the future of any and the nation rests on. Obi-Datti Media noted that Senator Mbu is a big addition to the growing Obidient movement because he has huge following, just as members of his APC cadre are likely to come with him into the Obidient fold. Obi-Datti, therefore  welcomed the distinguished Senator and called on all other lovers of a new Nigeria to join in taking back Nigeria for the much-needed rebuilding.
