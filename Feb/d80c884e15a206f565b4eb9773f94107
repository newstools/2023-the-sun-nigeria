… Says ‘He’s very dangerous’ Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper, Kevin Trapp has expressed his admiration for Napoli and Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen ahead of the meeting between the two clubs. Napoli will travel to the Deutsche Bank Park in Frankfurt am Main, where they will trade tackles with Eintracht Frankfurt in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League first knockout round fixture. The Italian Serie A giant is the heavy favourites to secure a first-leg advantage after an almost-perfect winning streak during the Group stages. But they face a Frankfurt side that beat all odds to power to glory in the Europa League last term. Napoli is high on confidence, however, having been the best team in Serie A by some considerable distance. And in Nigeria’s Victor Osimhen, the Neapolitans boast one of the most in-form forwards in world football this season. The Super Eagles striker has only one goal in Europe this term, with injury limiting his impact. But he has been devastating in Serie A, where he has found the back of the net in each of his last seven games and has 18 goals overall to sit atop the goalscorer chart. It would be interesting to see how Frankfurt’s defence and goalkeeper will fare against the most prolific Nigerian finisher in Europe’s top five leagues. While Trapp admits that Osimhen is one to watch, the 32-year-old German stopper believes the entire Napoli team has been excellent. “Osimhen is very dangerous, but it’s not just him,” Trapp told OmaSports TV, as per Tutto Napoli. “We’re talking about a strong team on the whole who are playing very well. “We know them; they’re an excellent team. They have many points ahead of their pursuers, and this is a fantastic thing.” Osimhen’s brilliant goal scoring run is about to help him unlock the first financial clause in the contract he signed with Napoli when joining from LOSC Lille three years ago.
