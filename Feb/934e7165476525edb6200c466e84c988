From Desmond Mgboh, Kano  Second Republic politician,  Tanko Yakasai has condemned alleged  moves by some Northern politicians to form an alliance against the APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu. The elder statesman, in a statement, yesterday, cautioned against such a position saying it was a dangerous path to follow as it posed a  threat to the unity of the country. Yakasai, who was former Adviser to President Shagari warned against allowing overambitious politicians undermine the peace and unity of the  country.  He said: “Forming a united front against a candidate from a different region, ethnicity or religion is not only against the spirit of our constitution, which guarantees freedom of thought and association, but it also risks triggering a reactive response from the affected region. This could lead to actions that threaten the stability and unity of our country and people. This move will earn the initiator the label of a sworn enemy to our nation and its people’s progress,” he said. Yakasai appealed to Nigerians to consider the consequences of their actions while appealing to traditional and religious leaders across the country to support his position. “Elections come and go, but we must act wisely and not engage in actions that could plunge our nation into a long-term crisis.  The tragedy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, instigated by the senseless misadventure led by Mois Chambe, Kasabubu and Mabutu, serves as a reminder of what can happen when leaders engage in reckless behavior,” he said.
