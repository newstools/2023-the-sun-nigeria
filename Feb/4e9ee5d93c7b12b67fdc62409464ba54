Former Enugu State governor, Chimaroke Nnamani has dismissed his expulsion from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  as a nullity. Nnamani, who is also the senator representing Enugu East senatorial zone in the National Assembly, as well as the PDP candidate for the zone in the 2023 polls, said the party’s National Working Committee (NWC) has no power to expel him. The PDP National Working Committee (NWC), after a meeting at Friday, announced the expulsion of Nnamani and six others from the opposition party. However, the former Enugu State governor said the Iyorchia Ayu led NWC did not follow due process and strict compliance with the  constitution of the PDP in arriving at its decision. The former governor, in a letter to the PDP NWC through his counsel Olusegun O. Jolaawo (SAN ) stated that it is only the opposition party’s National Executive Committee (NEC) that can sanction him. According to him, “On 20 January, 2023, the NWC conducted preliminary disciplinary hearing against our client and approved his suspension from the party for one month, purportedly acting pursuant to Article 57(3) of the Constitution of the PDP.  “It is evident on the basis of Articles 57(7) and 59(3) of the Constitution of your party excerpted above, that no organ of the party, including the National Working Committee, has the competence to entertain any question of discipline against our client, except the National Executive Committee of the party.”
