By Monica Iheakam Nigerian athletes, officials and their counterparts from other African countries will not be required to fill out landing cards on arrival in Ghana for the 2023 All Africa Games. According to reports emanating from Ghana, all contingents for the Games to be hosted by Ghana will not be required to fill any landing cards once they touch down at the Kotoko International Airport (KIA) in Accra. KIA vice-president Mahamudu Bawumia made the announcement about the change in decision via social media with the hope that it would be ready just six months before the Ghanaian capital is set to stage the African Games for the first time. “I held a productive meeting on improving the competitiveness of Kotoka International Airport (KIA) with key stakeholders, including the Minister for Public Enterprises, Minister for Transport and his deputy, the Ghana Airports Company Limited, Ghana Immigration Service, National Security and Ministry of Interior,” Bawumia wrote in a post on Facebook. “It was decided, inter alia, that airline passengers traveling to Ghana would, from March 31, 2023, no longer be required to fill out landing cards. Nigeria has competed at every edition of the African Games since its inception in 1965. At the 2019 Games held in Rabat, Morocco, Team Nigeria represented by 308 athletes finished second on the overall medals table with 46 gold medals, 33 silver medals and 48 bronze medals.
