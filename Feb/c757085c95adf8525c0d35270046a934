From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja Five observer groups on the platform the Collation of United Accredited Election Observers at the weekend, called for conduct of fresh elections in places where BVAS failed to function and polling units where over voting were reportedly recorded in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). The group noted that while the election process was peaceful and orderly in many parts of the FCT, it was marred by serious logistical issues and some avoidable irregularities, such as the malfunction of the BVAS Machine, which failed to capture many willing voters while others could not vote because the polling units were moved, and were thus disenfranchised. The press conference was led by the group’s Head of Missions, Dr. Onwubuya Abraham. Abraham said: “We further observed certain late arrival of materials and late starting of voting in over 38% of the Polling Units in FCT such as Wuse Zone 3 Ward Unity School, Apo Legislative Quarters Zone 4 Ward 018, which has 2,942 registered voters, with shortage of Adhoc Staff of INEC that complicated the process of the voting exercise “Mixed Up of voter registers in over 32% of polling units in FCT interchanging with various polling units, hence throwing voters in to confusion “Omission of voter’s name from the voters register of their original polling units hence they could not be accredited, this happened in about 18% of the Polling Units in FCT. “We observe over-voting in numerous of the polling units in many wards in Kubwa Wards in Bwari Area Council “We also observed that over 45% of the polling units in FCT could not upload their result in the BVAS Machine after voting by the INEC Adhoc Staff, due to network challenges according to them, which may give room to manipulation of results “We also observe cases of misplacement of sensitive materials by INEC Adhoc Staff, in the wrong polling units other than the original polling units hence depriving voters from exercising their civic right. “We observe that INEC has a major challenge of result collation and management which may be addressed to enhance credible process of election in Nigeria “We therefore, resolved that INEC review the ongoing coalition of result process, whereby conduct fresh elections where BVAS fails to function and polling units where over voting were recorded especially in Bwari Area Council and AMAC respectively, for the sake of credibility of the process and to allow level playing ground for all candidates”
