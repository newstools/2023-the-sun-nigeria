By Chinyere Anyanwu       Farmers in Edo and Delta states have been given some expert advice best farming methods to adopt against the backdrop of recent prediction of early rainfall across Nigeria by the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMET).  Among experts in the agricultural sector in the states who offered the advice to farmers, Segun Solomon, the Director of Extension Services, Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), Benin, warned the farmers against planting with the first rain to minimise losses. Solomon who spoke in Benin said it was advisable to begin planting when “the rains are relatively steady. It is very good that NIMET provides some level of rainfall predictions to guide Nigerian farmers. “It is advisable for farmers not to plant with the first rains. Experience in the last three to four years has shown some level of dry spell after the first rains. It is advisable to commence planting when the rains are relatively steady to minimise losses,” he said. He said adequate rainfall is good for agriculture with good management practices for improved yields. According to him, the issue of climate change has greatly affected weather predictions and agricultural production all over the world. Also reacting to the NiMET prediction, the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, Peter Aikhuomobhgbe, advised farmers to plant their crops when the rains are steady. Aikhuomobhgbe said normally, the month of March was the beginning of the farming season in Edo, but farmers were advised to plant when the rains were established. “We have had rain in January in Edo; if farmers had planted in January, you can imagine what would have happened because there has been no other rain since then. Only those farming by the riverbank with irrigation can plant when they like to plant.”
