From Molly Kilete, Abuja  The Nigerian Armed Forces, Police, and the Department of State Services (DSS) have vowed to deal ruthlessly with anyone or group who attempts to interrupt tomorrow’s presidential and national assembly general elections in the country. They said those wanting to scuttle the peaceful electoral process should have a rethink or live to regret their actions. The warning was handed down at a media briefing organised by spokespersons of the security agencies at a joint press conference held at the Defence Headquarters, Abuja. Addressing the media, the Director, Defence Information, Brigadier General Tukur Gusau, maintained that the elections will hold in all parts of the country and urged Nigerians to discountenance threats from non-state actors as the southeast remains part of Nigeria, where elections will be held. He said the security agencies were more than ever ready and prepared to do everything within their powers to ensure a peaceful election devoid of violence. The Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, speaking on the readiness of the police, said the restriction of movement from midnight today until after the election tomorrow will be strictly enforced, as he warns non-voters to stay away from polling units. He advised those who have their voting centres far from where they live to relocate by today as the restriction of movement would be fully enforced, save for those on election duty. Also speaking, the Public Relations Officer, Department of State Services (DSS), Peter Afunanya, while assuring that the service remains committed to protecting the nation’s democracy, called on citizens to go out and carry out their civil responsibilities.
