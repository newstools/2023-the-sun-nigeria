From Molly Kilete, Abuja  Gunmen have invaded Munu, a community in the Abaji Area Council of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), killed two people and abducted scores of villagers. The incident was said to have taken place at about midnight Tuesday night, when the gunmen stormed the community in their numbers, shooting sporadically. The incident, which lasted for over one hour, according to the villagers, resulted in the killing of two villagers and abduction of several others. The gunmen were also said to have engaged in the looting of a beer parlour and a provision shop before leaving the village with the abducted persons. It was gathered that some personnel of the mobile police force deployed to the neighbouring community of Rubochi, housing the Federal Government College, who visited the area upon hearing the sounds of gunshots, arrived in the area after the gunmen had gone, but promised to come back. One of the villagers, who did not want to be mentioned in print for fear of being attacked, said: “Some mobile police force personnel deployed to our neighbouring community of Rubochi, where the Federal Government College (FGC) is located, visited us about 30 minutes after the attack and promised to come back for fact finding.” When contacted, the FCT Police Command Public Relations Officer, Josephine Adeh, promised to find out the true situation of the attack as soon as possible and get back to Daily Sun, but failed to do so at the time of filing this report.
