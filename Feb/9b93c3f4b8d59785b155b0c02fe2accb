It was an unusual scene at a funeral in Anambra State on Saturday when the bereaved family provided a POS machine to sympathisers on which to make condolence donations. The incident occured over the weekend at Isuofia in Aguata Local Government Area, which is the hometown of state Governor Chukwuma Soludo. According to a video trending online, the digital burial was organised by the Orafu family. Aside the POS machine provided by the mourners, the video also shows an account number where those who want to make transfer can send their condolence token. A masculine voiceover that accompanied the video also announced that the family would not accept old naira notes from any sympathiser, while also informing that naira scarcity wonâ€™t be an excuse for one not to pay condolence visit to the family, as alternative means of payment have been provided. Recall that the introduction of new naira notes and outlawing of some old ones by the Central Bank of Nigeria has led to scarcity of naira notes in the country, as the acceptable notes (the legal tenders) are in short supply and scarcely available to the people. The situation has not only generated a chain of actions and reactions in different parts of the country, but has also compelled people to start making cashless transactions and exploring other means of payment, which were hitherto underused in the country.
