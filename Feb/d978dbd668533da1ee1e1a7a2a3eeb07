From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja  Chairman of Southern and Middle-Belt Leaders Forum (SMBLF), Chief Edwin Clark, has described Delta State Governor and vice presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Ifeanyi Okowa, as a traitor who betrayed the region for his selfish interest. Clark in an open letter to Okowa titled “Your dictatorial government and the reign of unaccountability in Delta State” accused Atiku’s running mate of  being nepotistic, totalitarian, clanish and corrupt in the management of the state. Clark, vowed that Okowa would not succeed in his vice presidential candidate project because he was selfish. In relation to the handling of public resources, he also accused Okowa’s administration of lacking accountability. He accused the Delta governor of siphoning state government funds to actualising  his vice presidential ambition. Clark said Okowa succeeded in intimidating opposition in the state by his misuse of power. The elder statesman expressed the regret that Okowa was partnering with leaders who betrayed President Goodluck Jonathan like Atiku Abubakar. He said  Okowa betrayed the  Southern Governors Forum and used the Asaba Accord as a platform to negotiate a safer ground by accepting to serve as running mate to Atiku Abubakar.  He said Okowa knew he had the intention to run as running mate when he agreed with his fellow governors from the South that they should not accept to  be running mate in any of primaries of any political party. He also accused Okowa of directing delegates from Delta State to vote Atiku in the PDP primary against Southern Nigeria candidates despite the agreement reached in the Asaba which Okowa coordinated and the position of the Southern and Middle Belt Leaders Forum.
