Ajax Amsterdam boss, Johnny Heitinga, has apportioned some of the blame on the Nigeria international’s poor form to him still trying to adapt to a new style in The Netherlands. Ajax’s new manager has used the 23-year-old sparingly.  The former Everton defender took over the reins in Amsterdam following the sacking of Alfred Schreuder, as he looks to get their Eredivisie title bid back on track. Bassey has been heavily criticised by elements of the media, pundits and fans since his move to Dutch football.  In particular, the ex-Gers star’s use of the ball has been pinpointed as a weakness. He started Ajax’s Europa League last 32 play-off match against Union Berlin last Thursday. However, he was back on the bench during their 4-0 victory over Sparta Rotterdam on Sunday. He did get a 20-minute cameo at the Johan Cruyff Arena, as Heitinga, 39, subbed the powerful defender on. And the boss offered some support to Bassey and his struggles, insisting he’s still looking to overcome the way he was used to playing in Scotland. He told ESPN: “Calvin is a top professional. He comes from Glasgow and knows a different way of playing. In Holland, a lot is demanded of the ball and you play with a lot of space behind you.  “He can defend. We have to help him and make sure he has plenty of opportunities, but we know how long the rest of the season is. We are going to need him.”
