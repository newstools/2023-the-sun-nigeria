By Christopher Oji  The Lagos State Police Command has rearrested two ex-convicts and one other for the same offence of robbery. The suspects were nabbed by operatives of the Rapid Response Squad (RRS) of the command while they were robbing a passer-by on Olowopopo Way, beside Otedola Bridge. The Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), Benjamin Hundeyin, said: “The suspects: Osazee Festus, 33; Martial Anthony, 23, ex-convicts, and Osinachi Nwachukwu, were arrested in the early hours of last Saturday.  “The trio, wielding a cutlass, accosted their victim at about 6:20am and dispossessed him of his Samsung A19 mobile phone.  “The victim promptly alerted RRS officers close to the scene, who swiftly arrested two of the suspects and recovered the phone. Investigations following the arrests led to the arrest of the third suspect.   “Osazee was released from prison on February 2, 2023, after eight months behind bars, while Anthony regained freedom in June 2022.” Meanwhile, Commander of the RRS, CSP Olayinka Egbeyemi, has transferred the suspects to the Command Headquarters for further investigations.
