Super Eagles striker Kelechi Iheanacho was in his elements as Leiceter City came from behind to register an incredible win against Tottenham  at the King Power stadium . Iheanacho scored a goal and bagged an assist for Leicester who produced a vibrant performance to punish Spurs with a convincing  4-1 Saturday afternoon. The Nigerian international  capitalised on some more hesitant Spurs defending as he toyed with Eric Dier before beating Fraser Forster. Harvey Barnes rattled in a fourth having had a strike disallowed moments earlier to take Leicester up to 13th. Tottenham took an early lead at the King Power Stadium during their Premier League trip to the East Midlands. But Nampalys Mendy (23’) struck out Rodrigo Bentancur’s (14’) goal with a sublime strike. James Maddison (25’) then hit before Iheanacho (45+4’) delivered a third. Harvey Barnes scored a late fourth as his Foxes took their goal tally to eight in two matches. Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi made his return from injury, coming off the bench in the 69th minute of the game to shore up the midfield and defensive lines.  Iheanacho has netted three goals and bagged four assists this ongoing season through his 16th top-flight appearances for the Foxes  this season. He had hit home one goal and created a further two assist when Leicester beat Aston Villa 4-2 last weekend .
