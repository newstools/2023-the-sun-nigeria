Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has distanced itself from a so-called meeting in Aba, Abia State, where ultimatum was given to ‘unknown gunmen’. MASSOB said the group of people claiming to be pro-Biafra agitators was merely stocking crisis in the South East. A statement by its National Director of Information, Edeson Samuel, reiterated MASSOB’s commitment to pursuing the independence of Biafra through non-violence approach, negotiation and dialogue. It stated categorically that they were not part and will never be part of such meeting where faceless groups hide under Biafra to enrich themselves.  As one of the leading groups in the Biafra project, MASSOB said it knew the real Biafra agitators and their leaders.  The group’s spokesman said: “We have an umbrella that unites us, called ‘Coalition of pro-Biafra agitators’ with the name known as Biafra National Council (BNC). This is the only body that unites all the genuine pro-Biafra groups. “MASSOB wish to make it clear that we do not participate in such a meeting where Ndubuisi Igwekala was appointed as their leader as well as giving the unknown gunmen ultimatum. “MASSOB believes in non-violence approach and through consultation, negotiation, we can restore peace in Igbo land.”
