The IGP equally met with the previous batch of Police Constables who were trained in weapons handling, police tactics/techniques, human rights standards in arrest/detention/search of persons or vehicles, and public order management. The summit with the theme “Ensuring Secured and Safe Atmosphere for Nigerian Women and Youths during Election Process”, took place at the Police Force Headquarters, Abuja. The summit, which dissected the roles of the electorates, particularly women and youths, urged cooperation with personnel of the Nigeria Police and other security agencies engaged in election security management for robust security before, during, and after the 2023 general elections.
