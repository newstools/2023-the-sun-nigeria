Nigeria Favour Ofili sprinted to the third position in the 60m event at the New Mexico Collegiate Classics finals held at the Convention Center in Albuquerque over the weekend. Ofili breasted the tape in time of 7.21, falling short of the 7.09 time set by her compatriot, Rosemary Chukwuma in the same event a fortnight ago. Freshman, Ella Onojuvwevwo clocked a huge personal best, erasing almost a second off her previous 53.57 best at the same New Mexico Collegiate meet. Her time of 52.61 slides her into her school, Louisiana State University, LSU’s all-time top 10 list (8). The time also pushed her to number eight in the Nigerian all-time 400m indoor list ahead of Fatimah Yusuf who drops to ninth with the 52.63 she ran at the Green Dome in Maebashi, Japan in February 1996. Onojuvwevwo is only running her first season indoors after she gained a track scholarship to LSU last year. Meanwhile in the men’s 60m, Godson Oghenebrume ran a new 6.69 lifetime best a day after setting another personal best in the 200m (21.35).
