Allnigeriasoccer.com can exclusively report KAA Gent striker Ahmed Abdullahi will not train with the Flying Eagles in Morocco ahead of the upcoming Africa U20 Cup of Nations. Abdullahi is one of the seven players classed as strikers named in the Nigeria U20s final squad for the tournament in Egypt but has yet to report for international duty.  Though the tournament is not on the FIFA calender for international matches, Belgian Pro League side Gent have given the green light to Abdullahi to participate in the Africa U20 Cup of Nations after high-level talks with the Nigeria Football Federation.  The former HB Academy center forward, who has drawn comparisons with Napoli star Victor Osimhen, has given his word that he will arrive in the Egyptian capital, Cairo on February 14 or latest the following day.  There was really no point for him to travel to Casablanca, Morocco because the Nigeria U20 players and officials are flying to Egypt on February 16. Abdullahi is a player that manager Ladan Bosso knows very well as he was part of the Flying Eagles squad to the WAFU B U20 Championship in Niger, where he scored in a 2-0 win versus Ghana.  The 18-year-old trialed at  Borussia Dortmund, Marseille and Lorient with a view to a transfer before Gent won the race for his signature.
