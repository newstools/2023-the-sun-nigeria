The Catholic Bishop of Umuahia Diocese, His Lordship, Most Reverend Michael Kalu Ukpong has applauded the Chief Whip of the Senate, Senator Orji Uzor Kalu for the giant strides he has recorded as the Senator representing Abia North Senatorial District. The cleric specifically commended Kalu for the number of rural roads he has attracted to the Senatorial District, saying: “If others have done what he is doing today, Abia state would be a better place”. Bishop Ukpong stated this today during his Thanksgiving Mass at Mater Dei Catholic Church Umuahia, urging leaders to serve the masses selflessly when entrusted with leadership position. “When you go to my Senatorial District today, you will see so many projects ongoing including rural roads. This is unprecedented; if others are doing like him, Abia State would have been better. You may have your opinion, but when he was the governor of the state, we know how he performed. He is still the best till date even though he was younger then. Your Excellency, you are older now and I am sure you will get better as you grow old.” Kalu, who is the Abia North Senatorial District candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 general election has twice been voted as the best performing lawmaker in the ninth assembly. He emerged 2022 Best Senator of the Year in Constituency Projects in Leadership and Excellence Awards—the highly coveted award is endorsed by the African Union, African Film Institute. The former governor of Abia State and first term senator has within three years facilitated the construction of over 50 roads in Abia North. Elected in 2019, Senator Kalu has continued to receive torrents of accolades as result of the massive infrastructural and empowerment projects attracted to Abia-North in his first term at the Senate.
