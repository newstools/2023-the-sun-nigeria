From Aniekan Aniekan, Calabar The presidential candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, has promised to prioritise the development of the Calabar Port if elected at the pending poll. Speaking at the presidential rally held at U. J Esuene Stadium in Calabar on Monday, Atiku said when the port is properly developed the Eastern flank of the country will be served as employments will be created for the people of the state. He said: “I have factories in Adamawa and if the port in Calabar were working, I would not need to pass my goods through Lagos. “If you open up the Calabar port, the Eastern flank of Nigeria will be served by the Calabar port and that will be massive business and employment for people in this part of the country. “The moment Calabar port is functional it will be an attraction and benefit to the people. Developing the Calabar port will be a golden opportunity for the state and if you vote PDP we will implement this project which has been grounded by the APC. “Your agricultural produce will be to your own benefit if the port is functional”, Atiku said. Speaking further, he said restructuring the country is an important policy that will be implemented so that people would hold their leaders accountable at the local level. He also promised to inject 10 billion dollars into the economy to enable our young men and women set up small businesses. He thanked the people of the state for always having faith in the PDP, saying the turnout for the rally is “evidence of massive support we enjoy in this state”.
