From Desmond Mgboh, Kano  Conference of Northern States Civil Society Networks has appealed to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to resist the pressure of shifting dates of the general elections from any quarters or interests.  Its chairman, Ambassador Ibrahim Waiya, at a press conference, yesterday, in Kano, warned that succumbing to any pressure to postpone the polls would dent the integrity of the electoral umpire. “It has come to our notice that there are some alleged pressure from some quarters on INEC leadership to have the elections postponed. It  is our candid opinion that nothing is a worse disservice to the country than such an evil thought and imagination. It is our belief that the leadership of INEC would not contemplate doing that or succumb to any pressure to tamper with the integrity of the Commission.”  Waiya reminded INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmoud Yakubu, that all eyes were on him and Nigerians expected nothing less than a  credible, fair and transparent, elections.  The northern group also disassociated itself from protests by civil society groups in some parts of Lagos State calling for the sack of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa.  “The current leadership of the EFCC has not only changed the approach of the fight against corruption, but has also systematically introduced more durable reforms.”   He said the EFCC boss has discharged his duties well enough adding that he secured a record total of 2, 220 convictions of corruption cases from January to December 2021 and 3,785 convictions from January to December, 2022. He  charged the EFCC and its leadership to remain focused and not allow itself to be distracted by the activities of noise makers and  politically motivated sentiments and characters.
