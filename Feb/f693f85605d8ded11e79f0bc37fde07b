By Christopher Oji Crisis have erupted in some parts of Lagos following the announcement of Labour Party Candidate, Mr Peter Obi as the winner of the Presidential Election in Lagos . Supporters of the All Progressive Congress (APC),who saw the defeat of APC candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, as an affront,took to the streets, especially in Isolo and Lagos Island. The hoodlums who attempted to attack residents of Isolo were repelled by the Police , but on Lagos Island, shop owners at the popular Mandilas market were attacked. Howeve, Lagos State Police Command has debunked claims that people were being attacked , saying the what happened on Lagos Island was that some traders were having internal problem, and not attack on non indigenes as being rumoured. According to Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Benjamin Hundeyjin,the erupting violence is caused by traders who reneged on an agreement on not opening shops on Sunday and Monday. Hundeyin responded to a message shared by a Nigerian on his social media handle. The Nigerian had tweeted: “APC thugs are on the rampage on the streets of Lagos because Peter Obi won Tinubu. In Abibu Oki street off Broadstreet in Mandilas market Lagos Island, they are chasing the Igbos, robbing them and destroying properties.” Swiftly reacting to the tweet, Hundeyin described it as fake news. He added: “The market association agreed that shops would remain closed yesterday and today. Igbo traders this morning decided to renege on the agreement and open shops. Some hoodlums took it upon themselves to enforce compliance. The police were alerted. “The police arrived promptly. The hoodlums fled upon sighting police patrol vans. Not one shop was vandalised. Not one person was robbed. Not one person was injured. Normalcy was swiftly returned, and officers remain on the ground.” Hundeyin’s reaction has caused a mixed reaction, with some Nigerians accusing him of profiling a certain group of people.
