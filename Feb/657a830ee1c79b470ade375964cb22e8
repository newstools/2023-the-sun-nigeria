–Already grossed ₦60m for scoring 20 goals Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen will earn €260,000(₦120,000,000) if he scores thirty goals for Napoli this season. Osimhen joined Napoli from Lille in 2020 for a club-record €72million. He arrived at the club with high expectations, but he struggled to deliver in his first season because of injuries. However, the 24-year-old attacker began to deliver last season. He scored 18 goals in all competitions for Napoli despite being out for almost three months. This season, he has morphed into a proper poacher. He has been in spectacular form, leading Napoli’s charge for silverware with 21 goals and four assists in 25 games. Osimhen has been instrumental in helping Napoli maintain their spot at the summit of the Serie A. His performance has not gone without reward. Osimhen already earned €130,000(₦60,000,000) for reaching 20 goals this season. But there’s more to come. According to La Gazzetta Dello Sport per Napoli Magazine, the Napoli star has a clause in his contract that will see him receive an extra €130,000 if he scores 25 goals. If Osimhen scores 30 goals this season, he will earn an additional €130,000. Barring injuries, Osimhen has at least 15 games to reach 30 goals this season. He has scored ten goals in his last eight Serie A games, and winning the Scudetto for Napoli after a 33-year wait could be extra motivation for him. Nonetheless, this has been the best season of Osimhen’s career.
