Super Eagles striker Odion Ighalo scored four goals for Al Hilal to guide the team to a comprehensive 7-0 victory against Al Duhail in the semifinal of the Asian Champions League. Al Hilal was looking to seal a spot in the final of the Champions League when it took on Al Duhail at the Abdullah bin Khalifa Stadium in Doha. Super Eagles striker Ighalo returned to the starting eleven after he missed Al Hilalâ€™s previous game against Foolad. Al Hilal got off to a great start, and it was Ighalo who ensured it. The former Watford man scored twice in the first ten minutes to help the Saudi Arabian giants settle in nicely. Then Moussa Marega added two more for Al Hilal to make it 4-0 before the 28th minute. Al Dawsari then scored in the 38th minute to wrap up the first-half scoring and give Al Hilal a five-goal lead. The second half started in a similar fashion with the Saudi kings dominating play. And the team got an early reward through Ighalo, who scored just three minutes into the half. Ighalo got his fourth of the game in the 62nd minute to make it seven for Al Hilal and wrap up the scoring. Al Hilal will now play Urawa Reds in the final of the Asian Champions League. On the domestic front, Ighalo is in the race for the highest goalscorer, but he is five goals behind Talisca who is currently on top. Aside from Talisca though, he also has Cristiano Ronaldo to worry about. The Portugal star looks to have taken the league by storm. He just arrived at the club in January, but he has taken the league by storm with eight goals in his last three games. And most fans believe he would eventually claim the golden boot. However, after his feat against Al Duhail, Ighalo can draw inspiration and begin to bang in the goals for his club.
