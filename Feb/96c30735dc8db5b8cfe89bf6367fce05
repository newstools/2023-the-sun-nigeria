A chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Enugu State and former senatorial Aspirant in Enugu North Senatorial Zone, High Chief Chinedu Eya, has described Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi as the greatest Nsukka Man alive. Chief Eya spoke on the heals of the aftermath of the 2023 general elections in Enugu State, where Gov. Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi lost his Bid to represent Enugu North Senatorial District in the red chamber to Candidate of Labor Party, Okechukwu Ezea. Chief Eya who spoke from his residence in Nsukka Local Government Area Council, explained that the governor became the second Nigerian after the late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe to bring tertiary institutions to Nsukka Senatorial Zone. He, however, noted that the Governor also opened up the zone through his numerous road networks across Nsukka, with the Opi Nsukka access road standing tall to this testimony. His words: ” To me, Gov. Ugwuanyi remains a genius, and history would be kind to him. Those celebrating his defeat from Nsukka will definitely miss this great man and his kind gestures to our dear zone. “To me, He remains the greatest Nsukka Man dead or alive. “Let me remind you that after Late Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe that the Governor entered the history books when he gave us the school of medical and applied sciences in the zone as well as the Federal polytechnic in Ohodo, Igboetiti LGA. “We are not talking about road networks nor the human capitals he personally empowered and elevated both politically and otherwise across the zone. He further described the Governor as a great leader, who has worked very tirelessly to ensure speedy growth and even development of Enugu State in general, while urging the public “to accept whatever outcome of the general elections as power belongs to God. “His works for speedy growth and development abound in the state, and time will justify what I have said today”, he concluded
