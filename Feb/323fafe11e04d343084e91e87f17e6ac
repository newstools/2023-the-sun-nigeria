To encourage and sensitize members to take their health issues seriously, the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) in collaboration with Medicard Limited will on Saturday, February 11 kickoff ‘AGN Health and Wellness Week’ at Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos from 7am-4pm. In an interactive session with journalists in Lagos, Ejezie Emeka Rollas, president, AGN, said the issue of health and wellness of members is key to his administration. “There is nothing more important than health for any human being. This fact made us to introduce special retail Health Management Scheme (HMO) with Medicard Ltd. in 2020, and we have so far enrolled some indigent members on the scheme.  “In the same vein, we partnered with Universal Insurance to provide group on-set cover for members in case of emergency. All these and other juicy welfare packages have been put in place for members, but the apathy and lackadaisical attitude towards the welfare packages, including their health issues, are very discouraging. In view of members’ attitude towards their health, we have designed a weeklong health and wellness sensitisation programme aimed at creating awareness to enable members enroll on the HMO plan and insurance policy.”  The weeklong activities will feature lectures, health walk, free medical checkups, HMO and insurance renewals, and healthy and complete diet tutorials among others.  The AGN president, however, used the occasion to present veteran screen diva, Joke Silva, as the latest member of the Board of Trustees (BOT). There was also presentation of certificates of office to the newly elected National Executive Officers and letters of appointment to members of the team.
