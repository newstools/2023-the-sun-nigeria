A few days to the 2023 general elections, the Southern Youth Wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has rejected the same-faith ticket adopted by the ruling APC party. The youths who registered their displeasure against the same faith ticket in a statement signed by the Southern youth CAN chairman,Oluchukwu Nnabugwu, also called on all Christian youths in the Southern region to unanimously vote for only the party which he noted upholds the rule of religious tolerance in the country. Nnabugwu according to the statement maintained that the decision was made after due consultations with the Mother-body of the Southern Christian Association of Nigeria led by Bishop Maxwell Korie. He added that the present religious crisis witnessed across the country needs a government with different belief systems to restore the peace and unity of the Nation. “The outcome of the February 25th presidential election is going to either be the beginning of a new dawn or the inception of tyranny and nepotism in the country. “This election is going to make or mar the dividends of democracy which we have preached over the years. Therefore, We the Southern Youths wing of the Christian Association of Nigeria is rejecting in its totality the Same-faith ticket of the ruling party”. He said. Nnabugwu, therefore, advised the Christians to avoid being used by the politicians during the election just as he appealed to them to come out to vote for the right candidate.
