The Alimosho Arts Community Initiative (AACI), organisers of Kulture Fest, last week paid a courtesy visit to the president of Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria (PMAN), Pretty Okafor at the body’s new corporate office in Lekki, Lagos. Speaking on behalf of the AACI convener, Chief Obani Anthony Oluwabiyi Boyede Greenlyte, AACI team lead, Thompson Ubong, applauded Okafor for his leadership strides since emerging the PMAN president. He noted that the purpose of the visit was to formally meet with him and express his gratitude for protecting the interest of musicians as well as for introducing programmes in support of grassroots talents. Ubong also introduced Kulture Fest, the biggest art gathering in Alimosho, to the PMAN president.  Speaking about the success of Kulture Fest 2022, a member of AACI delegation, Favour Cyracus, stated that it was a rallying point for music acts in the Alimosho community as well as artistes from other parts of Lagos. To achieve greater success in the coming edition, the AACI team appealed to the PMAN president for guidance as well as sponsorship recommendations for the event. Responding, Pretty Okafor appreciated the gesture of the team while stressing the need for collaboration. He revealed the PMAN’s plan to organise a talent hunt and promotion campaign, which would be done in communities. He pledged the PMAN’s readiness to support Kulture Fest as a means to reach up and coming music talents within and outside the Alimosho community. Okafor was later presented with an artwork in appreciation of his service to the art community in Nigeria.
