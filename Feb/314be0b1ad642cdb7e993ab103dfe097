From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC), Rivers State chapter, has ordered its members to observe sit-at-home from Monday, unless  government addresses the lingering fuel and cash scarcity faced in the state. State chairperson, Mrs. Beatrice Itubo, in an interview said the civil servants in the state  would  directed to stay at home because the scarcity of fuel  is affecting workers  income. She spoke following the scarcity of fuel, cash and hike in transportation fare, stressing that their members were facing untold hardship and would not continue living in such a condition. “It is not a threat. It is not a strike. It is a sit at home directive. I have issued a press release and it is starting from Monday.  “Workers cannot be spending the salaries on the huge transport fare and other issues. We can’t continue this. If government fails to address these problems,  from where will they get money to be spending on transportation.” Meanwhile, a Port Harcourt resident, Mike Chikere, who is self-employed,  lamented that he begged a POS  operator on Sunday, give him N5,000. But he was given an option to pay N1,500 for N5,000. ‘I had no option than to collect N3,500. It’s very painful to parents that have children. You can’t endure watching your family members starve.  “I went to several POS operators today (Sunday). Other places were telling me they would give me N1,000 but would collect N200, meaning N800 I will go home with. “Another person (POS operator) said each N500 I will pay N100.  I am confused I don’t what is happening. I don’t know other people are passing through what I am going through.”
