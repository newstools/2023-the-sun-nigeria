After 23 matches in the topflight, the Nigeria international is the leading marksman with eighteen goals, five more than Inter Milan’s Argentina World Cup winner Lautaro Martínez, and six ahead of compatriot Ademola Lookman.  Statistically, Osimhen is in the best form of his career since turning professional, with seven goals in seven consecutive matches in the league – the first Napoli player to achieve the feat in the three points for a win era.  His goal against Sassuolo in the last round of matches was his 100th career goal in 197 appearances combined for club and country.  Only Manchester City’s goal machine Erling Haaland has scored more goals than the Nigerian in the top five European Leagues so far this season. In an interview with DAZN, via Tuttomercatoweb.com Giroud was asked to name the player who will win the top scorer award and he responded: “Osimhen. He does everything well, he has very high confidence.”
