By Bianca Iboma-Emefu The re-election bid of Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has received a boost from prominent support groups, one of them Team Prado (TP), which pledged to deliver votes for the governor’s victory. Team Prado showed its strength with a massive road show attended by hundreds of dispatch riders who were mobilised to support the governor’s push for a return to Alausa. The colorful road show which was the brainchild of Team Prado, a private initiative made up of Nigeria’s finest and best brains from all walks of life, is promoting and campaigning for the re-election of the governor and the actualisation of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu’s presidential ambition. Apart from investing a lot of resources and time in the public and through the use of SMART technological ideas, the support group is employing grassroots campaign strategies aimed at boosting the Sanwo-Olu for a greater Lagos drive. For Team Prado, the Sanwo Again project is a task that must be delivered considering the impressive first-term performance of the governor and his deputy, Obafemi Hamzat. Team Prado had organised several initiatives and programmers to elevate the governor’s profile as well as promoting the track record of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate. The latest initiative by Team Prado featured hundreds of dispatch riders who stormed strategic streets in Lagos to endorse the candidacy of the governor. They have plans to unveil other exciting events before the general elections this February.
