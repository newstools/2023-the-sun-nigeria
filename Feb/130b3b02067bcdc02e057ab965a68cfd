From Agaju Madugba, Katsina Katsina State Governor, Aminu Bello Masari, has ordered immediate termination of appointments of Commissioner for Works and Housing, Tasi’u Dahiru Dandagoro, the Permanent Secretary, Sustainable Development, Fatima Ahmed, and her counterpart at the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Aminu Waziri.  In a statement signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Muntari Lawal, Masari also sacked the Chairman, Katsina State Pilgrims Welfare Board, Yusuf Barmo.   A competent Government House source said the governor’s action may not be unconnected with the defeat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Tinubu, in Katsina.  Tinubu who polled 482,283 votes, lost to the PDP candidate, Atiku Abubakar, who received 489,045 votes from across the 34 local government areas.   “There is no doubt that government reviewed and is still reviewing roles of various persons that culminated in the party’s defeat in the state,” a source said.  But the SSG in his statement said dismissal of the officers was done “in the move to make some strategic re-alignments.  “All the affected political/public office holders are directed to handover all government property in their possession to the reflective permanent secretaries or the most senior director as the case may be.”
