Premier League table topper, Arsenal has abandoned its interest in red-hot Victor Osimhen after a report named the clubs who have an interest in the Nigerian. The Super Eagles goal poacher is one of the finest strikers around and probably the most in-form in the world, bagging 21 goals and four assists from just 24 appearances across all competitions. Osimhen, 24, is valued at â‚¬140million with his current deal at Napoli runs until 2025 but he is set to be the subject of big transfer interest at the end of the season. Arsenal was believed to also be in the race as they look to add a more potent front man to their squad. However, a report on Fichajes.net has named the clubs in the race for his signature and the Gunners are not among them. The Spanish outlet reveals the teams in the race now are Chelsea, Manchester United and Atletico Madrid.
