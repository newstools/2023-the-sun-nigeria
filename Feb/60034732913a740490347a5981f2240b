Flying Eagles winger, Kingsley James Awodi has said the experienced he gained with the team will spur him on to better his performance when he returns back to his base in England, BSN sports.com.ng can report. Kingsley was one of the four members of the team that failed to make the final 21-man list for the CAF U20 African Nations Cup in Egypt. He hopes to be part of the team to Indonesia at the FIFA U20 World Cup if the Flying Eagles pick the ticket at the U20 AFCON. He said the coach of the team, Ladan Bosso told him that he is still part of his plans for the world Cup adding that he was dropped not because he was not good enough but because the AFCON needs players with African mentality, vigour and strength but at the world Cup, his flair and European mentality will add value to the team. “I am happy and grateful to be part of the players that made the 25-man list to Morocco. Making the team to Morocco is a big achievement for me. “The coach told me that I was dropped not because I am not good enough but because he needs players with African mentality to succeed at the U20 AFCON. “What I have gained while with the team will spur me to improve my performance when I return back to Europe and hopefully when Flying Eagles pick the World Cup ticket, I will be part of the team to Indonesia. The 21-man Flying Eagles squad left Morocco for Egypt on Thursday ahead of their first group A tie with Senegal on Sunday.
