From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has described as fake the report that he ordered APC governors to disobey President Muhammadu Buhari’s orders. In a statement signed by Bayo Onanuga, Director Media and Publicity, of the Tinubu-Shettima APC Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), the ruling party’s presidential candidate insisted that he did not ask the governors to ignore Buhari’s order. He maintained that the governors that have declared that line of action claimed that they were acting on the ruling of the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land, insisting that he has no influence in this decision. “Our attention has been drawn to a fake viral news, claiming that Tinubu asked APC governors to ignore President Buhari’s broadcast and enforce the Supreme Court ruling on the recirculation of old Naira notes. “The publication by the platform is fake. Tinubu never issued such an order. Dele Alake, APC-PCC Adviser on Media and Communications never issued such advisory on behalf of Tinubu. “The message quoted randomly was shared on WhatsApp. Alake was not the author. Tinubu has been known, since the currency swap crisis started, to call for calm as the authorities try to find out a solution to the currency crisis. He has offered a six-point suggestion to lessen the anguish our people are facing in trying to get money from the banks,” the statement read. Reacting further, the APC candidate noted that; “he has also held several meetings with President Buhari, his leader over the matter. It is thus inconceivable and unthinkable that he would instruct APC governors to disregard President Buhari’s order on the currency matter. “Governors who have so far declared this line of action said clearly that they were acting on the ruling of the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land. Asiwaju has had no influence in this decision,” the statement read.
