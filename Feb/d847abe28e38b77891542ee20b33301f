A 70-year-old woman, Fatimoh Orelope, and five others were on Monday remanded in Ilesa correctional center by an Osun State Magistratesâ€™ Court for allegedly assaulting a chief, Dauda Ajadosu. Other defendants are, Babalola Motunrayo (35), Sulaiman Ganiyu (47), Kehinde Ojeyemi (40), Olutoye Taofeeq (35), and Olutoye Kayode (40). The prosecutor, Elisha Olusegun told the court that the defendants committed the alleged crime on the 15th of January 2023 at about 10:00 am at Obaagun town, Osun. He alleged that the defendants unlawfully assaulted Chief Dauda Ajadosu, attacking him with sticks, fist blows, and slaps. He said the alleged offenses contravened the provisions of sections 516, 351, 402, 86, and 451 of the Criminal Code Cap 34 Vol. II laws of Osun state of Nigeria, 2002. The defendant pleaded not guilty to the five count charges of felony, unlawful assault, a threat to life, theft, and destruction of belongings preferred against them by the police. Counsel to the defendants, AS Olaniyi, prayed the court to grant them bail in the most liberal and affordable terms. But, the prosecutor objected to the oral bail application of the counsel saying that capital offense was in the charge against the defendants. The magistrate, Dr. Olusegun Ayilara, ordered that the defendants be remanded in Ilesa correctional center and adjourned the case to 15th February 2023 for a ruling on the bail application.
