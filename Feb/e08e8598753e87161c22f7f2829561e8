Super Eagles coach, Jose Peseiro, has been spotted at the 2023 Under-20 African Cup of Nations currently held on the Northern side of Africa, Egypt. The manager made it known that he headed to the nation to see the matches of the Nigeria Under-20 national teams, one of which was played on Sunday and resulted in a loss of 1–nil. After taking over for Augustine Eguavoen in May 2022, the coach has only been able to lead the Super Eagles to two victories out of seven. Nonetheless, the manager has been working nonstop to get his team back to winning ways. By doing this, he has been seen in a number of locations and with certain individuals who may help with this process. In the past, Soccernet.ng has several reports on the former Sporting CP manager being seen at the Qatar 2022 World Cup, celebrating Taiwo Awoniyi’s well-deserved man of the match performance against Chelsea, attending Sunshine FC matches at the Akure Township Stadium, and also hanging out with the former Super Eagles manager, Eguavoen. Meanwhile, it would be recalled that the former Venezuela manager was also spotted observing the Flying Eagles crush the Junior Chipolopolo of Zambia in Abuja. In light of speculations that he has chosen four U-20 players to practice with the Super Eagles ahead of their AFCON qualifier against Guinea-Bissau, the Portuguese manager has opted to proceed with this by witnessing their games in Egypt.
