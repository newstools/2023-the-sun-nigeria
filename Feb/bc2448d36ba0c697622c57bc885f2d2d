Serie A has announced Victor Osimhen’s goal against Roma as the goal of the month for January. The Super Eagles talisman contributed to the Parthenopeans maintaining their dominance at the top of the league when they host José Mourinho’s men at the Diego Maradona Stadium. The Nigerian international fired in his 14th goal of the season with a cross from Khvicha Kvaratskhelia in the 16th minute from the kick-off time. Mario Rui slid a deft pass to the Georgian forward on the left side before crossing it to Osimhen, who brought it down on his chest and sent it wide past Rui Patricio. As a reward for the Nigerian’s outstanding technical gesture on Sunday at the Maradona, the league announced the goal on social media. “The goal of the month of January is from… …but whose? If not by @victorosimhen9” the League declared on their official Twitter account. Osimhen now has 14 goals, and four assists in 15 Serie A games this season, which has piqued the interest of several European clubs. He is, however, hoping to win Napoli’s third Serie A title after 33 years. xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
