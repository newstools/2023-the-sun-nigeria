From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Former Enugu State governor, Chimaroke Nnamani has insisted that his suspension by the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) National Working Committee ( NWC) for alleged anti-party activity is ill-motivated. Nnamani, in a statement, on Monday, said there was neither moral or constitutional basis for his suspension by the PDP leadership. He noted that there is no justice and equity in the opposition party, as both the party’s national chairman, Iyorchia Ayu and presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, are from the North. The former governor, who is the senator representing Enugu East senatorial zone, in the National Assembly, charged opposition party leadership to put its house in order. The PDP NWC recently suspended the former Enugu governor, who is also its candidate for Enugu East in the 2023 polls over alleged anti-party activity. However, Nnamani explained that his decision to pitch his tent with the All Progressives Congress ( APC), presidential candidate, in the forthcoming elections, is because of the alleged violation of the rotation principle in the PDP constitution. “The PDP ‘Penkelemesi’ suspension without hearing is incurably messy and will collapse. My decision to pitch tent with Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu was necessitated by the PDP refusal to comply with its own constitution to wit; that key political offices should at all times be rotated between the South and North to guarantee harmony, peace, fairness, equity and justice. “As it is now, there is no fairness, justice and equity in the PDP, because both the Presidential Candidate and the National Chairman are from the same region” “ I am only exercising my right for freedom of choice and association. On this score, I stand with Tinubu”, the former governor stated.
