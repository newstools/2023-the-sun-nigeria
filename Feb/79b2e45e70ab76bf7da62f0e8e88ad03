It was a Nigerian affair in the final of the 60m event at the Southeastern Conference, SEC, championships over the weekend in Fayetteville, Arkansas with Auburn University’s Favour Ashe and Godson Oghenebrume claiming the first and third positions respectively.  Ashe fulfilled his dream of emerging champions in the short sprint by  running a personal season’s best of 6.52 to win ahead of Jordan Anthony (6.57)  in second. Compatriot Godson Oghenebrume of Louisiana State University, LSU,  ran 6.64 to place third and make it a double podium finish for Nigeria at the event. It would be recalled that Ashe, had in an interview promised to not only win his first SEC 60m title to make up for the disappointment of getting disqualified at the same competition last year. He was also keen on becoming the third Nigerian to break 6.50 in the event behind Deji Aliu (6.48) and Olusoji Fasuba (6.49). Imaobong Nse Uko, a student-athlete at Baylor University has become the sixth fastest Nigerian ever in the 400m after racing to a new 52.19 lifetime best to clinch the third place. Uko’s  time places her behind 1: 50.73 Charity Opara (50.73), Regina George (51.05), Falilat Ogunkoya (51.25), Kudirat Akhigbe (51.81) and Olabisi Afolabi (52.15).
