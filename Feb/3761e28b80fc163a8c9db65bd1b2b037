From Okwe Obi, Abuja Minister of Women Affairs, Pauline Tallen has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP), among others, of being unfair to women in terms of political participation. Tallen who spoke yesterday in Abuja at a national dialogue on preventing violence against women in the 2023 general elections, organised by Women in Politics Forum, encouraged the women not to be weighed down by male-political domination. Recall that the Allied People’s Movement (APM), whose presidential candidate is a woman, collapsed its structure and endorsed Atiku Abubakar of the PDP ahead the February 25 polls. But the former deputy governor of Plateau State said: “Unfortunately, the National Assembly, in fact, all the political parties have not done well for women. I say it openly, including my party. Almost all parties are not fair to women. “It is not like we do not have qualified women. Despite all that, I do not want your spirit to be dampened. The struggle continues. We will continue to intensify (efforts) until we change their mind set.” WIPF convener, Barr Ebere Ifendu, called on relevant authorities to protect women against violence during and after the elections. “Women in politics wants violence addressed ahead of elections. This is like a continuation of the meetings with security agents and candidates; we want to see that violence is reduced drastically. “Women are mostly hit when there is violence and you can see that our situation in Nigeria today is very pitiable and scary; it’s so uncomfortable for everyone including the men because people are now feeling the impact women.”
