From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Allied Peoples Movement (APM) House of Representatives candidate for Bende Federal Constituency, James Obioma Nelson, has endorsed the Senate Chief Whip’s quest to return to senate for second term. In a statement, Kalu’s media aide, Sunny Idika, said the endorsement by the Item-born politician was in recognition of the contributions and laudable achievements of the former governor who represents Abia North senatorial district. Nelson said his endorsement was hinged not only on his credentials, but also his impressive transformational performance in the provision of dividends of democracy in the last three years. He pledged the loyalty of his supporters and that of his party to Kalu and vowed to work for his victory at the  February 25 election. Nelson noted that they have handed over the APM structure in Bende federal constituency to Kalu because, in the senator, they have seen performance, capacity, brilliance and competence. “I am endorsing him because this very election we are going into, is going to be different kind of election from what we have been previously having. Now, we are looking at performance; we are looking at individuals, we are not looking at party affiliations.  “If we see an individual that will give us the dividends of democracy, that will put smiles on the people’s faces, that will bring what we need down to the grassroots, what else do we need? It is to endorse him, and that is why I am here to endorse Kalu.” He urged the people of Abia North senatorial district to unite and re-elect Kalu, as he has performed excellently and was going to do more after 2023.
