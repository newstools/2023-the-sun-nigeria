From Paul Orude, Bauchi Immediate past House of Representatives speaker, Yakubu Dogara, has described, as heresy, the infamous slogan of All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, called ‘emilokan’.  ‘Emilokan’ which literally translates to ‘it is my turn’ was popularised by Tinubu in one of his campaign outings to mean it is his turn to be president. However, in a tweet via his verified Twitter handle, @YakubDogara, the former speaker said it was a sin of heresy for anyone to say it is his/her turn to be president as power belongs to God and He gives it to whoever He wishes. He said the most generous persons were those who give silently without hope of praise or reward. “Doing things for others and demanding they pay you back amounts to doing the right things for the wrong reasons. “As we go to the polls remember we can not put a set of people, half addicted to rage and the other half addicted to delirium, into leadership and still hope that we can rise above the contradictions which define their very nature; for they will only reproduce themselves. “Note also that democracy anywhere does not give permission to its citizens to be their worst selves. A people who knowingly suborn the gormless into leadership positions have wittingly or unwittingly resolved never to rise,: he said. Dogara acknowledged that the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, was not perfect, but opined that nations are build by imperfect men and women. “Of course, I am aware Atiku is not perfect but throughout history, the task of building nations has always fallen on the shoulders of imperfect men and women. My only point is that the best of us must not be led by the worst of us. Atiku remains the best,” he said.
