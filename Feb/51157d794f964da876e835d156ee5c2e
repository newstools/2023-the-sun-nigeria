The former Kaizer Chiefs star had been training with Swallows for several months, but the club’s recent FIFA transfer ban prevented him from registration before the sanction was lifted last week. According to the South African news outlet, The South Africa, Akpeyi has finally secured a new home with Swallows. “He had been training with Swallows earlier in the campaign already, but at the time the Soweto side wasn’t able to resolve their transfer ban, leaving the player in limbo.  “However, he has now penned a six-month contract with an option to extend it by two years,” the outlet added.
