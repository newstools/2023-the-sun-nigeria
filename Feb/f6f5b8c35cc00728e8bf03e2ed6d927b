Legendary Nigerian footballer Austin Okocha has shared his opinion about Russian football. Okocha sealed his place as one of Nigeria’s most talented and successful players without playing in Russia. The former Bolton Wanderers playmaker excelled in Germany, France, England, and Qatar before calling quit on a career that saw him named BBC Africa Player of the Year twice. While discussing Russian football with RB Sport (via Sport Express), Okocha laments never receiving an offer to play for a Russian club. The ex-Eintracht Frankfurt ace confesses he would have loved to play in the largest country in the world because of the famed passion of their football-loving fans. But Okocha, who once tried his hands at music, admits it would have been difficult for him to survive in the severe cold conditions typical in Russia. What has been said? “Unfortunately, not a single Russian club has made me an offer in my entire career. I would love to play for the RPL club,” the 49-year-old said. “I don’t know all the intricacies of your football, but I’ve heard a lot about the fans – many people told me that they are just crazy. I like such fans who scream throughout the match and inspire great performances. “As for football, I think Russia has a high level. But, as many people told me, and I myself thought about it, – Russia is more of a hockey country, not a football one, after all. This cold on the street in Moscow is a horror for me.” Okocha won gold medals at the 1994 Africa Cup of Nations and the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games before picking up one silver and three bronze medals at the Afcon between 2000 and 2006. He retired from active football two years later.
