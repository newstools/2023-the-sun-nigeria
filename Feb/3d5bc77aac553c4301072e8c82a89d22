The Non-governmental organization, based in Dublin, Ireland said it’s time to pay more attention to the girl child, as they remain an important part of any society that wants to develop. The foundation chairman, John Akpan and coordinator, Emmanuel Etu said 18 teams registered for the tournament. “So far, it has been a wonderful event with all teams showing their skills. The final holds today and it promises to be exciting. The winner will go home with a N100,000 with a trophy. Second and third places go home with N75,000 and N50,000 respectively. Like I said, this is the maiden edition and we hope to increase winnings as we move ahead,” Etu said.
