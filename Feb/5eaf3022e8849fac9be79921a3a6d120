The African Democratic Congress (ADC) on Monday distances itself from the purported endorsement of other political parties and their candidates for 2023 by a faction of the party. The ADC, in a statement released by Senator Patricia Akwashiki, Board of Trustees Chairman, in Abuja, described the alleged endorsements as fraudulent, void and of no effect since they were being carried by a faction of the party not known to law for pecuniary gains. It blamed a faction of the party, led by its embattled National Chairman, Ralph Nwosu, for the anti-party activity. According to the party, Nwosu’s faction has allegedly divided itself into three groups which are now illegally engaged in endorsing parties like the All Progressives Congress (APC), Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party (LP) for 2023 general elections all in a bid to make quick money. The party warned those involved in the act to desist or face the full wrath of the law. “They have divided themselves into three groups and collected money from APC, PDP and Labour. One party, three endorsements within the space of four days. Shameful.” The party under the interim leadership of Senator Patricia Akwashiki said that those who did the endorsements were “impostors” and “impersonators” who were no longer members of the party and therefore has nothing to do with the authentic ADC recognised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The ADC added: “This condemnable action will not stop our party or its presidential candidate from running the race to the very end. “We are determined to ensure that the bright chances of all ADC candidates in the forthcoming general elections are not sold ormortgaged as was the practice in the past.” “The arm of the law will soon catch up with all those responsible for these activities.”
