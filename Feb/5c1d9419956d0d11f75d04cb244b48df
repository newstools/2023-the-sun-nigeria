Former Africa 100 meters, Olusoji Fasuba, says the doping charges against Divine Oduduru could see the second fastest man in Nigeria serve a six-year ban. In a chat with www.brila.net, Fasuba argues that the scandal is a stain that can’t be washed off from the young sprinter’s career and it will always be a stigma if proven to be true. “I have never been in that kind of position and I have never put myself in that kind of position. So, it’s a tough one to say. I don’t see how anyone can come back from that if the case happens to be true. “Although I haven’t heard from Divine’s point of view, it’s something you will never come off from because it’s always going to stain your name and stain your name for the rest of your career if you ever come back,” he said. Fasuba also insists that blame should be shared proportionately between the coaches and the athlete, but should be more on the coaches if the athlete is younger.  However, Fasuba, using himself as an example, claimed that it still comes down to discipline and will power. “I would like to say the blame is between the coach and the athlete and in terms of the younger ones, I will say it’s more of the coach. Some of these coaches try to introduce them to the athletes and I think it’s more of the upbringing or the will power of the athlete to say no. “I remember as a young kid growing up, I can’t remember the coach’s name because it’s long time ago, he came and told me that he will give me some drugs that will make me run fast and my response to him was why don’t you take it and run fast yourself, I don’t need it. “So, it’s more on the part of how people perceive it. So, I will blame the coach more than the athlete,” he submitted.
