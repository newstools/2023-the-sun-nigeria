Talks have reached an advanced stage between top African sports channel SuperSport and the Interim Management Committee (IMC), organisers of the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL), for the competition to be televised starting from its second round, reports, insideNews247.com. A top official of the league managers disclosed authortatively to InsideNews that starting from the second round of the league, the Nigeria Premier League will be on cable satellite. “We have almost finalised everything with SuperSport. It’s just for us to dot the i’s and cross the t’s,” he said. The official said the deal is massive, and the 20 premier league clubs will benefit from this new TV right.  “It’s huge and that’s all I can tell you for now,” disclosed our source. It will be recalled that in 2013 the now defunct League Management Committee (LMC) announced that it has secured a five-year deal, supposedly worth about $34 million, with satellite broadcaster SuperSport to show two NPFL matches every weekend. The deal between LMC and SuperSport, which was supposed to run from 2015 to 2019 was terminated in 2017. SuperSport was said to have pulled out of the deal because it was not favourable to it financially. It had requested to renegotiate the terms of the contract, for it to be able to pay in Naira. The failure to reach a compromise with LMC had led to the deal suffering a premature death.
