He said candidates that sat for English Language were 58,012 out of which 44,162, representing 76.13 per cent got credit and above, while the number of candidates that sat for Mathematics were 57,700, out of which 43,096, representing 74.69 per cent got credit and above.

Similarly, on the issue of examination malpractice, he said 11,419 candidates were booked for various forms of malpractices as against 4,454 in 2021. According to him, the feat was achieved largely due to the improvement in the strategy and technique adopted by the monitoring officers. “This has led to the blacklisting of four supervisors, one each from Rivers and Plateau states and two from Ogun State for aiding and abetting as well as poor supervision,” he said. The 2022 SSCE external was conducted by NECO from November 21 to December 21, 2022 and is being released just after 57 days. Wushishi said 29 subjects were examined as it was done in 2021.
