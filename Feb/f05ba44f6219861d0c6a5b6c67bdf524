From Aidoghie Paulinus, Abuja The Government of Finland, has called for questioning, a member of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Simon Ekpa.  A source within the diplomatic circle, confirmed the development to Daily Sun. Also, an official of the Embassy of Finland in Abuja, in an email to our correspondent, following Daily Sun’s enquiry, said: “Yes, the arrest of Simon Ekpa as reported in Helsingin Sanomat, a Finnish newspaper, is true.” However, Daily Sun could not ascertain if Ekpa was released on bail or is being detained by the Finnish authorities as at the time of filing this report. Helsingin Sanomat, in its report titled ‘A Nigerian activist active in local politics in Lahti is suspected of a crime in Finland,’ said: “A Nigerian activist active in local politics in Lahti is suspected of a crime in Finland. “The Central Criminal Police confirms that it suspects the man arrested in Lahti on Thursday of a crime in Finland, but does not comment further on the matter at this stage. “The Central Criminal Police arrested and took Simon Ekpa, a municipal politician from Lahti of Nigerian background, away from his home in the center of Lahti.” Ekpa’s activities, it would be recalled, formed the basis in which the Minister of State, Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Zubairu Dada, met with the Finnish Ambassador to Nigeria, Leena Pylvanainen, on February 14th. During the meeting, Dada, on behalf of the government, called on the Finnish Government to take drastic action against the activities of Ekpa who lives in Finland, but sent inciting messages back home to instigate violence activities in part of the country with the sole aim of disrupting the conduct of the 2023 general election. Dada expressed displeasure over the orders given by Ekpa to his teeming followers whom he said, “consequently embarked on killings, maiming, burning and other destructive activities,” while also saying that Ekpa’s action is fast becoming a threat to the forthcoming election
