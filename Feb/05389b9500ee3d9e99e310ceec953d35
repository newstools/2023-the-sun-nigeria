…say poor banking network frustrate business  From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri  Grocery sellers, petty traders and artisans in Borno, have lamented over poor sales due to scarcity of naira notes across the country.  Aliyu Abubakar, a grocery seller in Maiduguri told Daily Sun he lost over N30,000 in a week as most of his items were rotten due to low patronage.  He said he also lost some amount as money transfered to him electronically by some buyers, did not drop in his account.  “The buyer usually show me the e-receipt of successful transfer and assured I will get it but never got  most of them. My business money is lost. Government has really caused bad situation for us,” he lamented.  Auwal Mohammed, a meat seller said he decided to close shop “for now” until the naira notes are available. He said he took the decision after spending three days at ATM to withdraw only N5,000, part of his sales.  “I suffered to get that N5,000. I was on queue at the ATM. They pushed me one day and I sustained injury on my hand,” he disclosed.  He said though feeding his family of seven has been tough but maintained doing business now could cause him more setback which may be difficult survive even after the naira crisis may have been addressed.  Long queue and crowd of people still persist in most ATMs in Maiduguri on Tuesday even as banks declined to collect old notes .
