BSNSports.com.ng gathered from the Sun of the United Kingdom, that the Blues’ new owners believe the Nigeria international could be the final piece in a puzzle having already spent more than £600m. And they would be prepared to break the British transfer record of £107m they have just set for Enzo Fernandez to land Osimhen. The striker, 24, is set to be one of the most in-demand players in the next transfer window. Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain are among the clubs also in the hunt for Osimhen, whose 14 goals in 16 Serie A games have sent Napoli to the top of the table. The Italian giants don’t want to lose their star man but are confident of generating a high-stakes auction for a player who will have two years left on his contract in the summer.
