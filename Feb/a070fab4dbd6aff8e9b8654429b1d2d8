From Ben Dunno, Warri A coordinated Joint Task Force show of force was organised yesterday across Delta State to prove the readiness of security agencies to secure lives and property during the forthcoming elections. It was the first major assignment to be carried out by the new Commander, 63 Brigade/Sector 1 Op Delta Safe of the Nigerian Army, Asaba, after he took over office from his predecessor, Major General David Saraso, who had since resumed as Commander Sector 2 Joint Task Force (North East) Operation HADIN KAI, Damaturu, Yobe State. The operation which started as early as 5am, took place at various locations under Sector 1 Command, comprising Anwai, Ugbolu, Oshimili, Ibusa, Ogwashi-Ukwu, Akuku Igbo,Â Illa, Agbor, Aboh, Kwale, Abraka, Eku, Orerokpe, Osubi, Uvwie and Warri as well as other adjoining towns in Udu, Burutu, Bomadi and other riverine communities. Residents of the affected communities who were reported to have expressed apprehension on sighting heavy military buildup, later relaxed when they discovered that the Joint Task Force operatives were for a different business. In Warri, the men and officers attached to the 3 Battalion under the Sector 1, were seen along the popular NPA Expressway to Warri-Sapele road, Jakpa road, Effurun Roundabout and other adjoining major roads to Udu council along the DSC Expressway as well as the Warri River in their gun boats to register their combat readiness and alertness. Along popular Warri-Sapele road, residents were seen applauding the Joint Task Force for their commitment to the sustenance of the peace being enjoyed today in the city and other neighboring towns, especially in Ekpan and Effurun both in Uvwie as well as Ovwian-Aladja in Udu areas that had been engulfed by both communal clashes and other forms of violent crimes. At Ekpan, the long convoy of JTF operatives were seen moving slowly and majestically on the major road that transverses the community in their usual combat army pickup with various rifles as a way of informing the trouble makers in the area that it would no longer be business as usual, particularly as the elections get closer. It was learnt that for more than 9 hours the operation lasted, the men did not show any sign of tiredness, as they were seen retiring to their barracks to receive further briefing from the commander.
