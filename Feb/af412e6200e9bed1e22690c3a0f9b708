From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu A Federal High Court sitting in Enugu has struck  out  the suit seeking the disqualification of all the candidates of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), in Enugu State from taking part in the 2023 elections.  Delivering judgment on Friday in the suit instituted by the African Democratic Congress (ADC), Enugu North Senatorial District candidate, Chika Idoko, the presiding Judge, Justice Folashade Giwa-Ogunbanjo held that the plaintiff lacked the locus standi to institute the suit. Idoko had in suit No: FHC/EN/CS/217/2022, Idoko had dragged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the PDP, and all its candidates in Enugu State to the court  claiming  that the PDP primary election was in contravention of Section 77 of the Electoral Act and should thus be voided, while the party should be punished in line with extant provisions of Section 84 of the same Act.  He argued that the party submitted its membership register to INEC on May 6, 2022, less than 30 days to its primary election, contrary to the provisions of the law. In delivering judgment, the judge held that the court lacks the jurisdiction to entertain the suit and that it will be an exercise in futility to continue with the matter and therefore struck it out.
