From Okwe Obi, Abuja Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has been urged to release more cash to banks for public use as most potential voters have been severely hampered by scarcity of the naira. Co-Founder of BAT TV, Maryam Ahman, who made the call, yesterday, in Abuja, regretted that the recent monetary policy by the CBN has further impoverished the masses, adding that the policy came at a time the country was struggling to win the war against poverty. Ahman said if things work better after the general election, Nigeria would be one of the greatest countries in the world, adding that the country has a creative and vibrant youths and women population, vast natural resources, resilient people, a dominant diaspora population and an enviably rich cultural heritage. She further called on Nigerian women and youths to take up the challenge of renewing the hope of the land by actively participating in the forthcoming election and to do so based on basic democratic tenets. “In an atmosphere of peaceful co-existence and unity in diversity, where a suitable governance structure is in place with leadership that prioritises good governance and accountability, we can renew our hope and a new Nigeria can be born.” He said in the last eight years, the Buhari administration has been battling with protracted national crises inherited from the previous administrations. She said at some point, it felt like Nigeria was at the precipice and needed urgent actions to be taken to rescue it from a myriad of challenges. “However, through creative strategies anchored on an open and transparent governance model, a lot has been achieved to stabilise the country and return it to the path of growth and prosperity. The present administration has invested heavily in critical infrastructure, agricultural development, security and accountability in governance. Therefore, it is important to sustain and improve upon the current trajectory.”
