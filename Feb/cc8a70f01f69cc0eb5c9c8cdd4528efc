Nigeria’s u-20 national team began the quest for a record-extending eight continental title on a disappointing note after suffering a narrow 1-0 loss to their Senegalese counterparts in their opening Group A match of the 2023 Africa U20 Cup of Nations in Egypt.  Souleymane Faye’s fine strike five minutes before the end of first half was all the Young Lions of Teranga needed to claim a memorable win over the Nigerian boys. The Flying Eagles will be particularly disappointed with the result after coming onto this tournament on the back of a long unbeaten run, which included a win over Zambia and Congo in the last couple of weeks. But after dominating the early exchanges, the Ladan Bosso-tutored side ceded ground and initiative to Senegal.
