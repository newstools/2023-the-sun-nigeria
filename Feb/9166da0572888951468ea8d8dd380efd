By Chinelo Obogo  Immediate past executive chairman of Okigwe Local Government in Imo State, Frank Onwumere, has denied authoring a petition alleging that the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) misappropriated N2 billion given by the presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, to churches. In a video released on social media and a statement made on his Facebook page, Onwumere said the signature on the petition does not belong to him neither does the Church, Dominion Centre International exists.  He said he has never met Obi in his life but that he is a strong supporter of the LP candidate and would not do anything to tarnish his reputation. “My attention has been drawn to a petition with the above subject matter purportedly written by one Onwumere of Dominion Centre International. “I wish to use this medium to inform the public, my associates, friends and family, that I, Pastor “Frank Alozie Onwumere, did not author the said petition and did not authorise anybody to do so on my behalf. “I and my entire family supports Obi even though I have never met him in my life. I have also never seen N2 billion in my life. If they are afraid of Obi they should say so, instead of lying against him.  “I don’t know anything about this publication. I have personally gone from church to church to find out where that letter emanated from. The signature on that petition doesn’t belong to me and I have personally traversed the entire state and I can tell you that the church doesn’t exist. “Be informed that I am not a member of Dominion Centre International and have never had any relationship with the organisation. The author of the petition is not known to me. Be assured that it is not in my character to malign any person or institution, let alone revered religious bodies,” he said.
