Chelsea legend Gianfranco Zola leapt to the defence of Victor Osimhen as he responded to Jose Mourinho’s claims that the Napoli striker must stop diving.  The Nigeria international has been strongly linked with a transfer to the Premier League, with Manchester United and Chelsea among the contenders for his signature in the summer transfer window. Mourinho warned Osimhen after Roma’s loss to Napoli in the Serie A last month that the number 9 would need to change his penchant for simulation at games especially if he heads to the Premier League. Zola noted that he sees similarities in Drogba’s playing style with that of Osimhen but suggested that the Ivorian ranked higher in physical ability. Responding to Mourinho’s diving claims, Zola told Sky Sports, via Football. London: “Because Didier was too strong to dive! I see a lot of similarities though.” Zola also branded Osimhen ‘a complete player’ and added that Chelsea would have to fend off competition from other top clubs to sign the Nigerian. The 24-year-old will have two years left on his Napoli contract at the end of the season.
