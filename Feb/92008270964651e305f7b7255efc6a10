The Super Eagles midfielder made his mark playing for Rangers and helping them claim the league three seasons ago. His consistent brilliance ensured that he was linked to many Premier League clubs like West Ham, Aston Villa, and Southampton. Eventually, he joined Southampton for just over €7 million. Unfortunately, things have not worked out since he moved to the South Coast. Aribo started well under Ralph Hassenhutttl. In fact, he scored a Maradona-like goal during pre-season. He also got games under his belt, albeit some were off the bench. However, the 26-year-old’s minutes have reduced drastically since early January. Aribo has played just 116 minutes in Southampton’s last nine games in all competitions.
