From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Kaduna-based commentator on national issues and former lecturer at Kaduna Polytechnic, Mohammed Garba, has faulted the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), CBN, over naira scarcity, saying that the monitoring power of the apex bank is weak, ineffective and lackadaisical. Garba challenged the management of the CBN to prove him wrong if movement of the redesigned currency to state branches across the country actually got to its destinations. Otherwise, he wondered why there should be scarcity of the currency if properly monitored and distributed to the relevant commercial banks for onward dispensing to customers across counters and ATMs. The former lecturer in a press statement called on the governor of the CBN to double effort in making the currency notes available, and save majority of Nigerians from ongoing untold socioeconomic hardship. “Without a manifest of new notes distribution by state branches of CBN to commercial banks (branch security) and published proof of monitoring, likely case of notes racketeering engineered by CBN is highly the other of the day. “Let the CBN deny that it has a special allocation of new notes to Aso Rock and other special people (Diplomatic Missions, etc). There were accusations that CBN officials had special allocations of foreign currencies, which they sold through their individually owned Bureau De Change outlets.
