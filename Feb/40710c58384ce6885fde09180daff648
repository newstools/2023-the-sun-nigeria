From Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin The Edo State Labour Party (LP) Youth Leader, Ken Omusi, has lauded the massive turnout of voters, especially young people, at the just concluded presidential and legislative elections in the state. He gave the commendation in Benin while x-raying the outcome of the elections in the state. Omusi said the just concluded elections have birthed the new Nigeria of their dream “I want to use this medium to appreciate all the youths in Edo State for coming out on the 25th of February to cast their votes and for voting wisely for a better Nigeria, a new Nigeria that we have been expecting,” Omusi said. While reacting to the question of how inclusive the government would be, the Labour Party Youth Leader, said this is the first time that the Nigerian youths have taken their destinies into their own hands. “If you look at Labour Party, you will see that this is the first time in the history of Nigeria that we are having a government of the people and so when you say carrying everybody along, it is everybody that is doing it, it is a collective government. ” If you look at what has happened also in Edo South which I know everyone is privy to the information that the so-called people who called themselves the ones governing us, they don’t even have results to show from their units where they voted”, Omusi said. He further called on the Nigerian youths to remain resilient as the quest for a better Nigeria is possible just as he said any act to subvert the will of the people will be resisted.
