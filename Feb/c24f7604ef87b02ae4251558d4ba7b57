From Magnus Eze, Enugu  Alaigbo Development Foundation (ADF) has restated its endorsement of Peter Obi and Datti Baba-Ahmed. It charged stakeholders in the South East, especially traditional and religious leaders, town unions and opinion leaders, to ensure the poll is peaceful in their domains. ADF president, Prof. Uzodimma Nwala, in a communique read to newsmen in Enugu, yesterday, said Saturday’s election was critical to the future of the Igbo and Nigerians in general. He said  the use of force in enthroning good governance and democracy in the society had failed and the only option left for Nigerians was political struggle through democratic means. “Consequently, those who preach election boycott or election disruption of the current electoral process are not doing so out of mature understanding of the nature of the political challenges facing us and our neighbours in the Nigerian federation. Yes, it is true that a people may boycott an election under certain political situations, especially under situations of utter hopelessness. This is not the case in the Nigerian federation of the moment.” ADF also urged people from other parts of the country to wake up and mobilise youths and all and sundry to ensure that people freely and effectively participated in the elections.  It further saluted Mr. Peter Obi for his courage, sagacity and vision for a new Nigeria, noting his tireless efforts in the bid to champion the new order which the youths and all patriotic forces in the country are yearning for and therefore driving along with him. It called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to ensure free, fair and credible elections in the forthcoming elections.
