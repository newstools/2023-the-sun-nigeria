A divisional police officer (DPO) and four other officers have been killed by bandits while repelling attacks on communities in Niger State. In a statement yesterday, the police spokesperson in the state, Wasiu Abiodun, said the bandits attempted to invade communities in Munya and Gurara Local Government Area (LGAs). Abiodun said the officers were able to repel the attack on a market in Munya LGA last Friday and also engaged the bandits during an attack on communities in Gurara LGA last Saturday.  He said although many of the bandits were killed, Mukhtar Sabiu, a divisional police officer (DPO) in Paiko, and four officers, also, lost their lives. “On 10/02/2023, at about 1500hrs, suspected armed bandits/insurgents attempted to attack the Chibani village market, via Sarkin-Pawa, Munya LGA,” the statement reads. “Police tactical teams and vigilance members mobilised to the market, where the hoodlums were routed and successfully repelled without any havoc, though the situation caused some panic, but normalcy was restored. “Similarly, on 11/02/2023, at about 1100hrs, information was received that armed bandits were sighted around Kwakuti-Dajigbe villages of Lambata, in an attempt to attack some communities around Gurara LGA. “Combined teams of police from Gawu-Babangida Division and Paiko Division, military, and vigilance members were drafted to the scene, the hoodlums were engaged in a gun duel and repelled with scores of them being neutralised, while others escaped with bullet injuries. Regrettably, DPO Paiko, SP Mukhtar Sabiu, and four other police personnel from both divisions lost their lives during the gun duel.” (Continued on www.sunnewsonline.com) The police spokesperson said Ogundele Ayodeji, Commissioner of Police in the state, led a team to the location to recover the bodies of the officers.
