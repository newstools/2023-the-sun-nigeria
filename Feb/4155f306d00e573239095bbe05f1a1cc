Finger that feeds many tongues   By Khalid Imam  A finger soaked in a calabash of honey  is what everyone would want to lick not one soiled with wet clay. I salute the finger that feed many tongues with honey. Oh Bukar Usman! To plenty souls, you are a honey soaked finger  all crave for your honey of erudition that cures ignorance. Your honey of generosity  offers great succour and relief  from heartless penury for hundreds of dozens  deeply drowned in its flood. To many dry throats, you serve as a rivulet of hope against the droughts of despair. Your kindness tastes  so succulently sweet like fresh milk.  Oh Bukar, a dutiful loyal son of Usman, your diligence is that of a watchful deer always. Today, I salute your patriotism to the great people of Biu and Borno.  I praise your deep love for Hausa language  and Arewa’s renaissance.  I hail your pan-Nigerianism — a detribalised river you are crisscrossing countless communities. I appreciate you as a dedicated man beaming the indoor room of our common humanity  with touch of your illuminating books.
