The result meant the Nigerian side have improved their position in the competition’s Group B, after losing by the same scoreline a week earlier to Diables Noirs of Congo Brazzaville. They were solid in their game this time, as against what happened on Match Day 1  when they conceded three goals within seven minutes and even lost a penalty kick. Rivers United opened scores in the opening minute through Malachi Ohawume, and they doubled their lead in the 42nd minute through Ukeme Williams. Three minutes into the second half, the hosts put an icing on the victory cake with a Ndasi Kadiang goal to seal the three points. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that Rivers United will visit Motema Pembe of DR Congo on Feb. 26 for their Match Day 3 fixture in the competition’s group phase.
