It was gathered that a tanker had brought Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) to a petrol station located on New Umuahia Road, Ogbor Hill, Aba. As the tanker was discharging its content; it suddenly caught fire which engulfed the petrol station. The incident forced many residents and shop owners around the area to scamper for safety. Sources said as the fire was raging, a female petrol pump attendant went into their office to bring out the money which was said be from the day’s sales. As she was said to have made her way out with the cash, the hoodlums reportedly bounced on her, collected the money and shared it among themselves.
