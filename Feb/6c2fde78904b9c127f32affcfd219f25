From Fred Itua, Abuja A coalition of lawyers in defence of human rights, has called on the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno, to identify police officers who allegedly joined masked gunmen to attack the House of PDP Ideato North South federal constituency, House of Representatives candidate Ikenga Ugochinyere, shooting, detaining and destroying properties. On January 14th in Akokwa, Imo State, motorcades conveying the gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s House, burnt his house, cars and killed his uncle and three others. While the police has sadly been silent on this matter, again, on Tuesday masked gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s house with explosives. The coalition in a statement signed by their convener, Tochukwu Ohazuruike, said supposed Ikenga had run afoul of the law, he could be invited for questioning, rather than breaking into his home, terrorizing his family, kinsmen and supporters. “We call on security to perform their Constitutional duties of protection of lives and properties by ensuring that the culprits are caught and prosecuted,” he said. The statement reads: “The constant attacks on Ugochinyere is in violation of his fundamental rights under the Constitution which include; right to life, liberty, fair hearing; private and family life; freedom of thought, conscience and ; freedom of expression and movement. “We call on security to perform their Constitutional duties of protection of lives and properties by ensuring that the culprits are caught and prosecuted. We particularly urge the the National Security Adviser (NSA), Maj. Gen. Babagana Monguno, to identify FIB officers who allegedly joined the masked gunmen to in the attack on Ugochinyere.”
