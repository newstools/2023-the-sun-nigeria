Following their ouster from the 2023 FIBA World Cup, the head coach of Nigeria’s senior male basketball team, D’Tigers Ogor, Daudu has expressed his sadness about the outcome of the qualifier, BSNSports.com.ng report. The Nigerian team started the final window of the qualifier like a house on fire last week beating Ivory Coast and Guinea back to back. Their defeat to Angola on Sunday finally sealed their hope as Cape Verde picked the final qualification slot. While speaking on the qualifier, Daudu was proud of the team’s performance but not happy about their non-qualification. “It’s too bad that we did not make it to the World Cup but I think we put up a good fight and we can say we are proud of ourselves”, he said.
