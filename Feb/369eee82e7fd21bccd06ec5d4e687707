From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for the Borno South Senate seat, Kudla Satumari, has alleged a plan by the governing All Progressive Congress (APC) in the state to deny him victory in last Saturday’s polls. Satumari made the allegation through a statement he sent to Daily Sun on Tuesday. “We have concrete evidence to prove that elections were conducted in some areas of Southern Borno without the use of BVAs in Gwoza, Shani, Bayo, Damboa and Kwaya Kusar,” he claimed. He also claimed he was leading in places where BVAs were used for accreditation, alleging “massive manipulation to tilt the election in favour of APC candidate. “I have personally called and notified the INEC state REC of the non-usage of BVAs for accreditation in Ngoshe, Gwoza local government area when it was first observed before more evidence poured in,” he said. The final results of the Borno South Senate seat are yet to be published by INEC. APC Senate candidate Sen Mohammed Ndume could not be reached for comment.
