Habu Gumel, President of Nigeria Olympic Committee (NOC), has urged sports federations in the country to step up preparations for the three major games Nigeria would be attending this year. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the three major Games include the African Games to be staged by Ghana. The others are the Africa Beach Games to be hosted in Hammamet, Tunisia and the World Beach Games scheduled to hold in Bali, Indonesia. The Africa Beach Games will serve as a qualification event for the Bali Games. Tony Nezianya, the Public Relations Officer (PRO) of NOC, in a statement quoted Gumel as saying Nigeria should be adequately represented with victory in mind. Gumel added that this was important since the Federal Ministry of Sports and Youth Development had approved the Games. ”The Ministry has approved Nigeria’s participation in those Games and has sought the assistance of the NOC to accredit athletes and officials for those events. ”We need to prepare well to win gold, since our last gold medal was at the 1996 Atlanta Games,” he said. The NOC President also said the African Games scheduled for Ghana from Aug. 4 to Aug. 14, 2023 was still within the cards. He added that a more acceptable date would be decided within the next couple of weeks.  “The African Union (AU) has set a committee to fix actual dates. When this is done, there will be an announcement to that effect.  “The Games are important because they will be an Olympic qualifier for most events in the Olympic Games.”
