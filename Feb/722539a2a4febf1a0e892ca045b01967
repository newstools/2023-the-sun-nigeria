Deadline day signings Paul Onuachu and Kamaldeen Sulemana were handed their debuts off the bench at half time, with Jones encouraged by their individual cameos.  “They made a difference,” he said. “They gave us an impetus and we looked better, put more balls in the box and were a better team.  “Late on, they only put one ball in the box, people go to sleep, don’t follow a runner, don’t compete and get a free header from six, seven yards. We didn’t have any free headers from six seven yards. You have to defend your box better. “It happened before I came, they didn’t defend the box well, and we’ve tried to improve that but it didn’t show today.”
