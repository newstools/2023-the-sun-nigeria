Contrary to reports in a section of the local media, seven-time African champions Nigeria will not be facing Congo in the quarterfinals of the 2023 Africa U20 Cup of Nations. By virtue of finishing first in Group B of the ongoing tournament in Egypt, Uganda set up a meeting with the Flying Eagles, the second-placed team in Group A, at the Cairo International Stadium, Cairo on Friday, March 3, 2023. The Confederation of African Football conducted the drawing of lots on Sunday evening to determine the top two teams in Group B and the move was necessary because Uganda and Congo were level on five points each with an identical goal difference at the top of the group. The Hippos of Uganda were drawn first, which gives them first place in the group and Congo secured second place. Five-time CECAFA U-20 Championship winners, Uganda reached the final in their maiden appearance at the U20 AFCON in 2021 but did not represent Africa at the World Cup because the tournament was canceled by FIFA due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Flying Eagles finished second in Group A of the U20 AFCON with six points after winning their group games against Egypt and Mozambique. Group A winner Senegal will face the third ranked country in Group C and Congo will meet the Group C runners-up.
