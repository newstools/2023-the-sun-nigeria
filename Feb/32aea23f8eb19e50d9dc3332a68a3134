Italian journalist, Ciro Venerato has asserted that French giant, PSG is interested in signing Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen from Napoli. Osimhen has been one of the best players in Italy in the last 18 months. The Super Eagles striker ended last season with 18 goals and six assists in all competitions. This season, the former Lille man has performed beyond expectations. He has outdone his personal best and sits on 21 goals and four assists in 25 appearances in all competitions. Osimhen’s displays have not gone unnoticed, as many top clubs have their sights set on him. Manchester United, Chelsea, Bayern Munich, Newcastle, and Arsenal have been heavily linked with the 24-year-old goal poacher since last summer. Also, Italian transfer market expert Venerato per Napoli Magazine has revealed that PSG are interested in signing Osimhen. The French have a lot of quality in the final third, but they lack adequate backup. As such, Osimhen is an enticing option. However, Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis may only let Osimhen go if he gets a very good offer. Nonetheless, Osimhen still has two years left on his contract and there have been no concrete extension talks yet. Napoli may hold out for over €120million.
