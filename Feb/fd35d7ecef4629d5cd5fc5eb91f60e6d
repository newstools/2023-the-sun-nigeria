Super Eagles midfielder, Wilfred Ndidi, has successfully rejoined Brendan Rodgers’s team after missing three games due to an injury he sustained in training. The Nigerian was forced to withdraw from games against Brighton & Hove Albion, Walsall in the FA Cup, and Aston Villa (4-2) due to a muscular strain he sustained in training. Brendan Rodger stated that the Nigerian would be recovering for “a couple of weeks” whilst being replaced by Nampalys Mendy, a Senegalese international, in the Foxes’ midfield. The 26-year-old was forced to exit the Super Eagles camp shortly before they were set to face Algeria in an international friendly match due to a hamstring injury he suffered in training. After that setback due to injury, speculation that Ndidi may be out for a longer time was rampant. That became a reality, however, as he was limited to only 45 minutes of the Foxes’ match against Steve Cooper’s Nottingham Forest in October. Since then, the Nigerian-born player has been absent for Leicester’s 2-1 defeat to Bournemouth, a scoreless draw with Crystal Palace, 2-0 win over Leeds, and 4-nil thrashing of Wolverhampton Wanderers. However, when he returned, all he could do was console his colleague from the bench while watching them lose to Manchester City at the King Power Stadium by a score of 1-0. He has played in seven matches for Leicester since his comeback, starting only three of them, one of which he captained in a loss to Liverpool. Ndidi, who returned from yet another injury stint with only 21 minutes of action against Tottenham Hotspur, could only express his happiness on his Instagram page as his side upset Antonio Conte’s men.  “What a performance by the boys! Good to be back +3,” he wrote. The Super Eagles star will as well be looking forward to falling in Rodgers’s favour to start for the Midlands when they visit the Old Trafford to face Manchester United this coming Sunday.
