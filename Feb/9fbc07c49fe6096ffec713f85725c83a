From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, has thrown his weight behind the new naira currency, whilst making an appeal to commercial banks to speed up action to make the new notes reality available to all Nigerians. Reacting to the chaos surrounding the adoption of the new notes, in a statement at the weekend, the presidential candidate said: “The currency redesign is not peculiar to Nigeria. It is an exercise that comes with some inconveniences and pains but it has significant long-term economic and social benefits.” “Even though there are improvements that can be made, I urge Nigerians to bear with the CBN and Federal Government with the hope that the general populace and Nigeria will harvest the gains that will come with the reforms.” Obi implored the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and commercial banks “to expedite efforts to make the new currency available to small depositors and the unbanked in order to reduce the pains of my fellow Nigerians, especially the underprivileged and those living far away from banks in the rural areas.“
