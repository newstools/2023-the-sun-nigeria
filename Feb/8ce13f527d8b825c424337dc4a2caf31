From Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) said it has constituted a legal team comprising over 300 lawyers that would help the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), to prosecute electoral offenders. The NBA President, Mr. Yakubu Maikyau, SAN,  who disclosed this yesterday, said the association  has already declared its’ readiness to offer their service to the electoral body, free of charge. Maikyau,  who briefed newsmen at the NBA Election Situation Room, condemned the actions of President Muhammadu Buhari,and other political office holders who publicly displayed their thumbprinted ballot papers to indicate the party they voted for. Describing the action as condemnable, NBA maintained that it was not examplary, saying it would not hesitate to take up the prosecution of those that compromised the secrecy of the ballot. “The NBA condemns such an action, because it is not examplary. It is not something that should be done by anybody in position of authority. “We condemn such act and if the people involved are charged by INEC for acting in breach of the Electoral Act, we will also offer our pro-bono service, except maybe for those that are currently enjoying immunity. “However, if after they exit office and they are charged for breaching the law, we will also prosecute them. “We stand for the rule of law and no one, no matter how highly placed is above the law. That is the emphasis of the NBA”, Maikyau, SAN, added.
