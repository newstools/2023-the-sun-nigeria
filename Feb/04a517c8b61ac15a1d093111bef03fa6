From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri The Justice Development, Peace, Caritas Commission (JDPC), an organ of the Catholic Church, has explained its interest in the peace accord it initiated for candidates of all the political parties contesting election in Imo State in a bid to curb election violence often associated with elections in the state According to the director of JDPC, Reverend Gerald Njoku, the accord would be a written commitment by all the candidates of the various political parties involved in the election. This, he pointed out, would help in checking the violent activities during and after the election. Said Njoku: “As we approach the next rounds of election, the Catholic Archdiocese of Owerri is committed to assisting in conducting a free, fair and credible election in Imo State devoid of violence. “The church, in playing the role of speaking for the voiceless, has often been misunderstood and sometimes maligned, but it will continue to advocate justice and good governance. The spate of violence has become a source of concern to the church, which is as a result of desperation by the politicians.  “We would demand from the candidates a written commitment to run a violence free campaign that will lead to the elections. Election is not a do or die affair,” the cleric warns. Earlier before the commencement of the town hall meeting, which is also part of the event for the candidates to present their manifestos to the public, the Catholic Archbishop of Owerri, Lucius Ugorji had cautioned the candidates on the adverse effects of violence in an election and enjoined them to play by the rules.  Osita Izunaso, Senatorial candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Senator Ezenwa Onyewuchi of the Labour Party(LP) Imo East, and Uche Onyeagucha of the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) for Imo East Senatorial constituency were among those present at the occasion.
