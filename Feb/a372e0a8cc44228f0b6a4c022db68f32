From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha The President Generals of the various communities in Ogbaru Local Government Area of Anambra State under the auspices of Ogbaru President-Generals Forum (OPGF) have endorsed the senator representing Anambra North senatorial district, Stella Adaeze Oduah for another tenure in the senate. In a communique signed by the President Generals Forum and PG Amiyi, Prince Afubera Nwanze and its Secretary and PG of Odekpe, Barr. Innocent Nwanosike as well as 13 other President Generals said the endorsement was based on Senator Oduah’s visible track record of service delivery and people oriented projects and programmes. The forum stated that the senator facilitated the construction/rehabilitation of over 150 roads, construction and equipping of school blocks in the various LGA’S, construction of ICT centers and diagnostic centers, market stalls, installation of over 3800 solar powered street lights in various communities within the zone, provision of over 245 water boreholes, instituting numerous skill acquisition training programmes for the Anambra North Youths. Other achievements of the senator Oduah according the group include; “instituting welfare packages for the indigent like her Ego Mbido Afia (cash) scheme that has been of immense benefit to well over 18000 indigent female petty traders, her Omueze farmers trust for farmers in our agrarian communities, scholarships, her numerous people oriented bills and motions like the recently passed bill for the establishment of a Federal Medical Center at Onitsha and the very pivotal bill for the establishment of a South East Development Commission which was resubmitted in the 9th Senate and awaiting presidential assent etc”. The group also frowned against the recent Omambala agitation for power shift maintaining that Omambala neither has the locus to make such claims after only wielding Executive and Legislative power for the past 8 years. They insisted that Omambala has infact, had the highest number of senators that ever represented Anambra North and wondered why such clannish and divisive sentiments should ever emanate from Omambala at a time when Senator Stella Oduah is on the verge of becoming a principal officer which invariably will naturally lead to more projects and programmes attracted for the good people of Anambra North. The President Generals however called on well meaning voters of Anambra North to stand solidly behind the Senator Oduah who is PDP candidate for her laudable performance and achievements in the past seven years.
