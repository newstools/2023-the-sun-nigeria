This project  has been delivered to an entire village. And that village, not only include the federal government workers, members of Federal Executive Council (FEC), who supported this project;   the National Assembly, the state government of Nasarawa State. “From Governor Tanko Almakura to Governor  Abdullahi Sule who provided a very safe environment to the contractor to deliver this project. “Your Excellency,  it might interest you to know that the contractor is a company called Faplins Nigeria Limited.  But more interestingly,  he is  a member of the opposition party. So,  while your party dislodged the opposition party, it did not dislodge the contractor from business. So, it continued and delivered and Nasarawa people were very receptive. What we have now is a built up of  6,702 square metres. It contains 402 offices. It has car parks capable of accommodating 300 cars as well as many other facilities including a staff canteen” he said.
