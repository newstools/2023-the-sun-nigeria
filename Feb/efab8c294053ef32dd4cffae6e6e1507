Nigeria international, Kelechi Iheanacho, has been picked as the star of the Leicester City team that defeated Tottenham Hotspurs 4-1 in the English Premier League over the weekend, owngoalnigeria reports. Iheanacho bagged a goal and two assists in the win that further helped his team to pull away from the relegation zone. The Nigerian has looked unstoppable since getting the faith of coach Brendan Rodgers the past few weeks. Last weekend, he played a little over an hour but before he was subbed off, he already did enough to ensure that his team runs away with all three points and it didn’t go unnoticed with former Spurs coach, Harry Redknapp singling him out for his performance. “Kelechi Iheanaco has been in the starting line-up in the last couple of weeks and he’s certainly delivered for his manager. He got a goal and assist at the weekend and he took his goal well,” he told BetVictor. “He’s always been a good, natural finisher and if he keeps this form up, he’ll remain in the side. Leicester was brilliant at the weekend, and he was a big reason why. He’s got to be my star man this weekend”!
