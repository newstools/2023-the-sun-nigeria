Nigerian International, Victor Osimhen, has recently been placed on the table of comparison following his outstanding performance for Napoli in the 2022-23 season. On the scale of many traits a striker possesses, the Super Eagles star has recently been likened to players like Manchester City’s Erling Haaland, and Tottenham’s Harry Kane, among others. In recent times, the media have diverted their attention to comparing Super Eagles talisman to the French Forward, Kylian Mbappé, to determine who the better player is. But, the Italian Journalist has weighed in on which of the two is the better forward. He acknowledges that the two players are distinct individuals, but thinks that the Paris Saint-Germain front is a terrific finisher and that the 24-year-old attacker is a better all-around striker. The journalist for Sky, Massimo Ugolini, said the following on Kiss Kiss Napoli’s “Radio Goal”: “Is Osimhen better than Mbappé? They are two different players morphologically and in terms of characteristics. In my opinion Mbappé is more powerful as a finisher. He is more beautiful to watch,” As reported by TuttoNapoli, he stated. The journalist feels that the Nigerian striker is complete, but he still has to demonstrate that at a top level, like the French international is now doing at his club and his country. “Undoubtedly, Osimhen is more complete. The Napoli striker is projected to be more complete than Mbappé, but he must demonstrate this at a top level, just as the PSG striker is,” he added. The Nigerian striker has scored 17 goals for the Parthenopeans in 18 league games this season, and scoring 8 goals in the year 2023, he is the only striker who has reached that height in 2023.
