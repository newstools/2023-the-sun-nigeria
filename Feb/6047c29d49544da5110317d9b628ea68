From Chijioke Agwu, Abakaliki The recent outbreak of cholera in parts of Ebonyi State is giving the member representing Ikwo/Ezza South Federal Constituency, Chinedu Ogah, cause for concern.   No fewer than five lives were lost, while many were hospitalised. Areas ravaged by the incident include Akahufu, Odumowo, Ochokwu, and Akataka Ofenekpe in Inyimagu communities of Ikwo local government area.  In intervening, Ogah has procured drugs to assist his constituents while calling on the Federal and State Government including foreign donors to render more support to the communities.  The drugs worth millions of naira, according to the lawmaker, were procured to ensure that victims of the outbreak received the best of treatment. He disclosed that the procurement of the drugs was carried out in partnership with the Ananda Marga Universal Relief Team (AMURT) led by Dr. John Omogo.  He further said that he has since assumption inception of office as federal legislator sunk several boreholes in the two local government areas he represents, adding that many more would still be executed to ensure that the people had access to good drinking water: “We decided to procure the drugs to assist our people that are victims of cholera outbreak. As their representative, it is part of our responsibility to come to their aid and that’s exactly what we have done. “The drugs, I believe, will go a long way to ensure that those who might still be in the hospital are adequately taken care of. We expect that with the arrival of the drugs, every hitch that would hinder their being attended to has been resolved and we are expecting good result from the venture.” Distributing the drugs at MDGs Health Centres in Akahufu and Udumowo Inyimagu, the village chairman, Mr. Chijioke Ekoyo and Pastor Sunday Nwizu, said the cholera outbreak was the least they expected in the villages, adding that the community enjoys potable water.
