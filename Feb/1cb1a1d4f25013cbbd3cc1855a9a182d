From Desmond Mgboh, Kano Kano State Governor, Abdullahi Ganduje has raised the alarm that elements behind the annulment of June 12, 1992 presidential election were regrouping to scuttle the nation’s democracy. He alleged the group was the mastermind of the High Court judgment that restricted  Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) from extending the February 10 deadline for use of the old naira notes. A statement by Kano Commissioner of Information, Muhammad Garba, quoted Ganduje as saying that the “unknown” parties who secured the interim injunction were using the court to impose hardship on Nigerians. “The group’s latest attempt is camouflaging in unknown political parties through the use of legal instruments to further impose unfeasible cash policy that is taking its toll on the masses in the country. The unknown political parties are also allegedly colluding with the main opposition party, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) to execute this fiendish scheme. It is unfortunate that the CBN and its collaborators are insisting unnecessarily on the imposition of an unreasonable time frame for the old naira notes to cease to be legal tender, in total refutation of the obvious national dearth in the necessary technological infrastructure for the process. The rigid insistence on the implementation of these harsh, inhuman, and insensitive cash policies to a point of neglecting their widespread rejection by the vast majority of Nigerians including the National Assembly and all state governors, is an ominous agenda for the undermining of the nation and consequent scurrying of a smooth transition to a freely and fairly elected successive administration.”
