This is unprecedented; if others are doing like him, Abia State would have been better. You may have your opinion, but when he was the governor of the state, we know how he performed. He is still the best till date even though he was younger then. Your Excellency, you are older now and I am sure you will get better as you grow old.” Kalu, All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate in the  general election has twice been voted as the best performing lawmaker in the ninth Assembly.
