…Pledges to turn situation around  From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja Labour Party (LP) Presidential Candidate, Mr Peter Obi on Tuesday, bemoaned the hardship that Nigeria has endured and vowed to improve things if elected to lead the country in 2023. Obi asked his followers to show more commitment as the election neared, warning that the country’s future would be unpredictable if Nigerians missed the chance to choose a competent president in the next general elections. The LP standard bearer spoke at the launch of his book titled: “Peter Obi: Many voices, one perspectives” in Abuja.  He said: “I have told all the supporters, various groups supporting me that we need people, we need all of you to support us, especially these final days to reach the end of this race. Nigeria has suffered a lot.this is a great country and it can be turned around. But we cannot succeed without your intervention, so as you launch this book, please be part of what we are doing to Nigeria. This is an existential election. I will urge all of you to be involved. If we get it wrong, no body can tell what next. All I know is that I always wish Nigeria the best and I know you people do. And I doing that, I urge you to be part of a new Nigeria that Dati and I are fighting for. Professor Okay Ikechuchukwu, while reviewing the book, said the 969 paged publication was at best a biographical testimonial with a historical focus.  “The subject matter is Peter Obi and that is the point. The central point we are making here and that lies in the central point of the work, is that if  people keep saying the same thing about a person for a long time, it must meet that there are bases for whatever they are saying. It must also mean that they are making verifiable claims. It must men that the man is, real, he is authentic and and it must mean that he represents what is presented today. Peter Obi is a man with community consciousness.” He stated.
