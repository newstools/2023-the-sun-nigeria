From Aloysius Attah, Onitsha Traders and stakeholders at Ogbaru Main market yesterday commended Governor Chukwuma Soludo for returning Chief Ndubuisi Ochiogu as chairman of the newly-appointed caretaker committee of the market.  Soludo recently approved the appointment of a 10-man caretaker committee for the market, with Chief Ochiogu as President-General.  Ochiogu had been elected as the President-General of Ogbaru Main Market Amalgamated Traders Association in January, 2022, and was sworn in by former Governor Willie Obiano administration; but in May 2022, Soludo’s administration dissolved Ochiogu’s executive committee of the market alongside 10 other markets leaderships in the state and appointed caretaker committees for the markets.  The dissolution prompted Ochiogu to drag the state Commissioner for Trade and Commerce, Mr Ngonadi, to court seeking to be reinstated because his tenure had not expired; but while the case was on going, Ochiogu in December, 2022, voluntarily withdrew the case from court for an out-of-court settlement. Ochiogu who received heroic welcome into the market yesterday after his swearing in at Awka pledged to push ahead with the lofty agenda he had already conceived for the market before the unfortunate incident of his sack. He commended Governor Soludo for giving him another opportunity to serve the market again, and thanked the board of trustees, patrons of the market and entire traders for the immeasurable support and warm reception given to him, and promised to do more by taking the market to greater heights. He assured that they would continue to support the administration of Governor Soludo, promising that Ogbaru Main Market would give APGA a 100-percent vote at the during the forthcoming general elections in the state. Chairman of board of trustees of the market, Chief Sam Mendu commended Soludo for returning Ochiogu, adding that his return to the market would mark the return of peace to the market.
