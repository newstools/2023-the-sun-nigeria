Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State has expressed worry over the incessant attacks and killings in the state by political thugs, warning  those involved to desist from such unlawful and heinous acts.  Umahi gave the warning yesterday in Abakaliki, during a statewide fasting and prayer service held by the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) and widows. The programme, in conjunction with Ebonyi State Government, at the Christian Ecumenical Worship Centre in Abakaliki, was to pray towards the conduct of peaceful elections. The governor decried the growing spate of political violence in various communities, saying he would consider banning commercial motorcycle operations in the state. Umahi noted that there was need for security agencies to be furnishing the government with information in its effort to check instances of security breaches for action. He said all hands must be on deck, by council chairmen, traditional rulers and the residents, to move Ebonyi forward by ensuring lasting peace and stability in the state. “I have learnt that most of the killings are being carried out by motorcycle operators. Well, for this, I may consider the banning of motorcycle any where in the state until after election,” the governor said. On cash crunch, he urged security agencies to ensure safety of customers and the financial institutions. Earlier, Rev Fr Abraham Nwali, the Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Religious and Welfare Matters, said there was need for fasting and prayers for successful, peaceful and credible elections in the country. He described peace as great gift to humanity.
