During some of the meetings of the 36th AU Summit, Buhari presented Nigeria’s positions on critical continental issues, including urging member-states of the Union to ratify the (AfCFTA) Agreement for the economic development of the continent, as well as calling on them to strengthen early warning systems to rein in conflicts. Meanwhile, the President is expected to lead other leaders of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), including the presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, to Lagos tomorrow (Tuesday) for the last of the party’s presidential campaigns.
