With a vision to empower the girlchild with professional soccer skills and experience to become relevant in the society, Navaney Foundation last week began its first Navaney Foundation Women Soccer Tournament 2023. The Non governmental organization, based in Dublin, Ireland said it’s time to pay more attention to the girlchild, as they remain an important part of any society that wants to develop.  The foundation chairman, John Akpan and coordinator, Emmanuel Etu said 18 teams registered for the tournament. “So far, it has been a wonderful event with all teams showing their skills. The final will be played tomorrow. The winner will go home with a N100,000 and trophy. Second and third places go home with N75,000 and N50,000 respectively. Like I said, this is the maiden edition and we hope to increase winnings as we move ahead,” Etu said.
