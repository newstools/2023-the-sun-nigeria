From Abdulrazaq Mungadi, Gombe The former governor of Gombe State and senator representing Gombe Central Senatorial District at the National assembly, Muhammad Danjuma Goje has celebrated his victory in the just concluded 2023 election. According to Goje, the celebration for him is beyond his success in the 2023 election but his winning streak which started in 1998 when he contested and won the seat of Senator representing Gombe Senatorial District on the platform of the United Nigeria Congress Party. Goje stated this while speaking to newsmen at his residence in Gombe shortly after he was declared the winner of the election for the Gombe central senatorial district. He said, “this is the eighth time I am contesting under different political parties, I have never lost an election, all thanks to Allah and my voters in my constituency. When I was declared winner of the election today, the first thing that came to my mind was an appreciation to Almighty Allah, because he has always made me a winner among my rivals”. “This victory has encouraged me to do more for my people, more especially because they (my constituents) forced me to contest and also ask me not to come to Gombe or campaign the way I used to. They have proven to me that the victory is theirs, therefore, I will make sure that I represent their interest and work for their well-being,” Goje stated.
