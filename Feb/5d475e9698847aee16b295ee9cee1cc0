The Judgement Creditors have earlier served Forms 48 and 49 on the 1st and 5th Contemnors to commit them to prison as for alleged disobedience to a valid and subsisting judgement delivered by the Court. Counsel to the 1st and 5th Contemnors,  Olajumoke Usi had filed a preliminary objection to the proceedings and the same was served on the Judgement Creditors on January 30, when the matter came up in court for the first time. M. O. Kukoyi and Onwe Francis also informed the court that they had just been served and wish to exercise their right of reply. Counsel to the Contemnors asked for a short adjournment to enable the court hear it before February 25, being the general elections, but the court made it clear that the matter did not fall within the purview of a pre-election matter.  The matter was adjourned to March 13, 2023 for hearing of the motion for committal.
