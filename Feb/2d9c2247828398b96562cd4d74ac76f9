By Bimbola Oyesola Against the backdrop of attacks on bank workers arising from the shortage of currency in the system, the organised labour in the banking sector yesterday ordered members to stay off work in any state that bank branches are being attacked. The union under the umbrella of the Association of Senior Staff of Banks, Insurance and Financial Institutions (ASSBIFI) said this became necessary to secure lives of its members who have been at the receiving end since the ugly incident began. The President of the union, Olusoji Oluwole in a statement issued on Friday lamented that the union has been “inundated with reports of threats and attacks on lives and properties of members and bank branches, and subsequently has been on the field to monitor and confirm the reports.” He said that the union has issued warnings and appeals to government to provide security measure for the safety of lives and properties of the members within and around the bank premises. He said “but regrettably, the attacks have continued without any form of security for the safety of our members, and the recent being the attack today, Friday, February 17 2023 on one bank branch at Epe, Lagos State.” The ASSBIFI president maintained that the union could not leave the lives and properties of members exposed to obvious danger. Consequently, all members should today immediately stay away from work in any state where bank branches are attacked,” he said.
