Solomon Agbalaka returned Nigeria’s Flying Eagles to winning ways with a second half header against the Young Pharaohs of  Egypt Wednesday evening at the Cairo International Stadium in Egypt. Full back Agbalaka’s header in the 71st minute ensured that the seven-time champions needed to secure their first points at the tournament. The tension soaked match was a win for both countries, however it was Nigeria that got the bragging rights at the end of the day. The Nigeria U-20 men’s team lost narrowly to the Junior Teranga Lions of Senegal 0-1 in the opening game on Sunday but still stands a chance of qualifying for the quarter-final stage of the competition.   Senegal’s victory against Mozambique automatically takes them to the top of the table while Nigeria is placed second. The Flying Eagles will play Mozambique in the last group game and a win will brighten their World Cup aspiration.  Nigeria lost 0-1 against Senegal in the opening day fixture. Senegal tops the table on maximum six points, having won her two matches while the Flying Eagles are second with three points. Hosts Egypt, who played a draw with Mozambique are third with just a point. A win for the Flying Eagles against Mozambique in the last group game will guarantee them a place in the semi final and berth in the FIFA U-20 World Cup in Indonesia in May.
