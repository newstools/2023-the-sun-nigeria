Nigerians have been advised to rally around Tinubu in his quest to become Nigeria’s next president.  Akinrogun of Akure Kingdom, Ondo State, and security expert, Chief Owolabi Ajayi, who stated this, said Nigerians stand to benefit more, especially the the Yoruba, if Tinubu becomes president. “Let me make this rallying call on all true sons and daughters of the Yoruba race to unite as one behind the candidature of Tinubu, one of the most formidable and experienced politicians to have ever emerged from Yoruba land.” He urged the people to remember the sacrifices made by Obafemi Awolowo and Moshood Kasimawo Abiola for democracy.  “The presidential election is not about political parties, but about the most competent candidate. When Tinubu was governor of Lagos State, he never neglected any ethnic group. He appointed people from different tribes in his cabinet. He is being supported across Nigeria because of his track records in Lagos and support for humanity.” Owolabi, CEO, Mainforce Security Services, also endorsed Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State saying he deserved “a second term due to his administration’s huge infrastructural development all around the state.” He also described Senator Adetokunbo Abiru, as “a focus, goal-driven and selfless public office holder, whose contributions on the floor of the Senate are second to none.” He also canvassed votes for Kayode Akinolu, as member of the House of Representatives, Lagos Island II Federal Constituency and Babajimi Benson to represent Ikorodu Federal Constituency. He described the duo as exceptional politicians with passion for public service.
