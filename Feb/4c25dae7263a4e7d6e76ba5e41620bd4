The Director General of the scheme, Brigadier General Yusha’u Dogara Ahmed, who handed the warning, urged the corps members not to undermine their security by embarking on unauthorised journeys. He maintained that his administration would continue to ensure that all corps members enjoy improved welfare and security. General Ahmed read the riot act on Saturday while addressing corps members during his visit to NYSC Kaduna State temporary orientation camp in the Kurmin-mashi part of the state. He said the contents of the NYSC bye-laws would be applied to every infraction, warning corps members to conduct themselves within the provisions of the law. “It is a thing of pride to serve your fatherland, but don’t risk your lives by unauthorised journeys. Be disciplined and prayerful. Also, be confident of yourselves, do your work diligently and l assure you, nothing will happen to you,” he stated. “Avoid crime, obey the rules and regulations in the camp, and respect your leaders”, the statement signed by Eddy Megwa, Director, Press and Public Relations, quoted the DG as directing. The statement also disclosed that General Ahmed also specifically warned the corps members not to indulge themselves in political arguments, but rather to participate as unbiased electoral officers, taking cognisance of the electoral laws during the forthcoming 2023 general elections. The NYSC Chief Executive equally advised them to ensure that they leave good legacies in their place of primary assignments and host communities. Giving camp situation report to the Director General, the NYSC Kaduna State Coordinator, Agbor Ndoma Obim, said that a total number of 1,077 corps members, comprising 407 males and 679 females were registered in the camp. He added that they have been participating fully in camp activities. While in Kaduna, the DG visited three corps members on admission at the 44 Nigerian Army Reference Hospital in Kaduna. They were deployed but on transit from Yobe to Anambra State for their Orientation Course, were involved in a ghastly motor accident in Kaduna State. The DG prayed for their quick recovery, commending the hospital management for the timely response made available for the injured corps members. While welcoming the DG to the hospital on behalf of the Chief Medical Director, the Administrative Officer of the hospital, Major OS Ojo, promised the hospital’s readiness to offer the best medicare for the injured corps members.
