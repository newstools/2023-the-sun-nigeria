Senegal coach, Malick Daf says winning against the seven-time TotalEnergies U-20 Africa Cup of Nations champions, Nigeria is a morale boosting achievement for his team. The Teranga Cubs earned a hard fought 1-0 victory over the Flying Eagles in their Group A match at the Cairo International Stadium on Sunday night.  “The result will greatly raise our morale and increase our desire to continue achieving more,” Daf told reporters.  “There was a strong desire from both teams to win. We worked hard and put together the right plan to face Nigeria and win.” “We thank God for achieving this important victory,” the former national U-17 coach said. “We faced the former African champions, who are a strong team, and they play very good football.” The West Africans will be hoping to secure their place in the last eight of the tournament in their second match of the group when they face Mozambique. Senegal will battle the spirited Young Os Mambas who held hosts Egypt to a barren draw in Cairo and is keen on the result to help advance to the knockout phase of the competition.
