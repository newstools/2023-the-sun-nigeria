From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Former president Olusegun Obasanjo has come over intense critism over his advise of cancellation of the election result on alleged irregularities by the Independent National Electoral Commission(INEC). Candidate of the National Rescue Movement(NRM) party Mazi Okwudili Nwa-Anyajike who condemned Obasanjo’s comment while briefing newsmen in Owerri warned that such utterances could incite members of the public to violence. According to him,rather than given such advise,he pointed out that he should urge aggrieved candidates or party to seek redress in a court of law. He said “The statement by Olusegun Obasanjo is uncalled for because election is a competition ,you don’t expect your candidate to win all the time, if a candidate is not winning ,what he should do is to approach the court if he felt cheated ,the court is there to rectify things. “it’s not about cancelling election ,first of all it’s going to cause Nigeria a lot of money to cancel election and it’s going to disenfranchise people that have supported another candidate that is winning,so if a candidate is not winning ,I think the best thing for you to do is to go to court . “Former president Obasanjo is very wrong this time because ,if he said it was wrong,how come he lost in his own polling unit,he shouldn’t have lost in his own polling unit. ” You don’t expect your candidate to always be the winner ,we have two hundred million Nigerians, all two hundred million Nigerians are not supporting Peter Obi ,some are supporting,Atiku,some Tinubu and some Kwankwaso,you can see the result going, the result is going head to head. “So i feel that his call for cancellation of the election is an indirect way of inciting violence in the society and an elder statesman like Obasanjo should not be doing that,we all want a peaceful nation,a peaceful transition to power ,so far the election has been very peacful”, Nwa-Anyajike. Nwa-Anyajike it would be recalled stepped down and collapsed his structure for the All Progressive Congress (APC) before the presidential election.
