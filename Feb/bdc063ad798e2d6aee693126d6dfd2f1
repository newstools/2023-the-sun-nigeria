From Tony Osauzo, Benin  Ambassador of Republic of Angola to Nigeria,  Eustaqui Quibato, has disclosed that the Benin Kingdom and Angola were intertwined through links with Portugal. He stated this when he took a duty tour of the Oba of Benin Palace where he revealed that the Portuguese that colonised Angola left traces of their history in Benin Empire. Ambassador Quibato who is also envoy to Benin Republic and Niger, while addressing the Benin throne, said it was a great pleasure to visit the palace and Oba Ewuare 11. He highlighted the giant strides of the Oba during his diplomatic sojourn to several nations, including Angola and thereafter solicited for prayers from the Oba. “I have the honour and pleasure to be here today. It is a great pleasure not only because I am in the palace, but for the link, our ancestry in this Kingdom.  “As you know, our colonizers (Portuguese) also came here (Benin Kingdom Centuries ago. They left part of their history here (Benin Kingdom).  You (Oba of Benin) spent part of your life in Angola. It means that this is our constituency,”Quibato said. Responding, the Oba of Benin, Oba  Ewuare II, shared some remarkable experience about his diplomatic mission to Angola and other countries before he ascended the throne of his forbears. Diplomatic relations between Benin Empire and Portugal began during the 13th Century reign of Oba Esigie — the first Benin monarch to have contact with Europeans, read and write as well as speak Portuguese language. This was before the Portuguese in their colonial expansion came to Angola and colonized the territory several years after the ancient Benin Empire and Portugal were both sovereigns and had diplomatic relations.
