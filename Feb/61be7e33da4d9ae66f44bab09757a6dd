From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa  bayelsa State Governor, Douye Diri, has declared he deserved to be re-elected as governor for a second term based on his performance in office. Diri, it was gathered, has already purchased the expression of interest and nomination form to contest the governorship primary of the Peoples Democratic Party slated for April. Speaking at his administration’s third anniversary thanksgiving service at the Ecumenical Centre in Igbogene, Yenagoa, Diri insisted his emergence as governor was not a mistake but by divine arrangement. According to him, before he became governor, there were clear signs that God had already ordained it and God made no mistake in using former governor Seriake Dickson as an instrument to bring him to office. While drawing attention to the blessings bestowed upon Bayelsa by God, he urged the people to shun the pull-him-down syndrome in order for the state to make progress. “Today, we are here to thank God for three years of our administration. When we started, there were predictions that we would not last up to a year but we are three years already. “The Bible tells us to rejoice and give thanks in all things and that is why we have come to say thank you to God on behalf of the prosperity government and the people of the state. “Last year, we had an unprecedented flood that affected us immensely. Even in the face of that flood, we said thank you. “Men with the fear of God will be the ones to lead this state. Men with development as their agenda. “Let us not pull ourselves down anymore. Let us support one another. Power always comes from God. “It is no mistake I am the Miracle Governor. Even before I was born, there were signs. When God wants to work, He uses instruments that no one expects,” he said. Delivering a sermon, President of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, Wale Oke,  lauded Diri and the people for their attitude of thanksgiving and implored them to cling to God, assuring He never disappoints.
