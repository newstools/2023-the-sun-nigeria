Chikwueze is currently having his most prolific season in front of goal with the appointment of Quique Setien bringing out the best in the left footer who has long been seen as a top prospect. What has been his biggest undoing was his final ball and goals but that can’t be said to have improved the past few months as he has found the back of the net nine times and also has seven assists in 49 games in all competitions. Sources close to the winger insist no talks have taken place regarding extending his contract leaving him with the option of leaving in the summer for a minimal fee. He currently has a buyout clause of around €60m but that won’t be considered in the event that he’s allowed to leave. A realistic amount, it was learnt, should be around €10-12 million.
