The Italian gaffer quickly debunked the injury fear and said it was nothing serious. “For what was assessed there straight away, it doesn’t look like anything special, just a bit of tiredness because he can’t spare himself. “When he has this urge to push, he stretches and does these runs where you don’t know where he’ll end up.  “He says he can hardly do it anymore and will go two metres, then those two metres become two hundred because he goes after everyone”, he told DAZN.
