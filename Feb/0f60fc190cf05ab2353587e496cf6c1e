From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri   New Theatre Commander of counter-terrorism operation in the North East, Maj. Gen Ibrahim Ali has raised the alarm that terrorists and insurgents plan to disrupt the forthcoming general elections in the region. Ali disclosed this, yesterday, at the Joint Task Force North East, Operation Hadin Kai headquarters in Maiduguri at his first meeting with journalists covering insurgency and military operations in the area.  He, however, assured that troops were prepared to guarantee security in the region to allow election.  “We are aware of terrorists who have sworn to disrupt the election process, but we are prepared to ensure security throughout the elections and even after elections,” Ali said. He said the theatre has put in place strategies to tame Boko Haram and its rival, Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP) based on specific instructions from military and army authorities to ensure safety of the election process and electorate. “We have instructions from the military command and army headquarters to provide security. We are also prepared to support the Nigerian Police to ensure security,” he said.  While soliciting collaboration from the media, Ali said the theatre under his command would step up synergy with journalists who he described as critical stakeholders. “We will collaborate with all stakeholders and the media is one of such critical stakeholders. We can’t win this war alone without the media support. It is critical to us,” he said  Ali assumed duty as the 12th Theatre Commander, Joint Task Force Northeast, Operation Hadin Kai headquarters in Maiduguri a month ago.
