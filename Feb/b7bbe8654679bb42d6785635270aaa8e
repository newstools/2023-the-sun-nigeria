The Trade Union Congress of Nigeria (TUC) said it would align with its sister body, Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) to ensure the  general elections remained on course. TUC’s President, Mr Festus Osifo and the Secretary General, Mr Nuhu Toro, in a statement yesterday in Lagos said a postponement or derailment might be quite costly for the country. The duo said that the union was urging governments at both Federal and State levels, and the monetary institutions to return the country to normalcy as it would not want to overheat the already charged polity. “One week ago, TUC issued an ultimatum on the growing restlessness in the country, occasioned by the twin debilitating challenges of currency crises and severe fuel scarcity. “Our proactive move was partly to bring the seriousness of the situation to bear on the government, mobilise our members for a possible intervention, and assure the Nigerian people that they can count on us. “The fact is that the situation has not drastically improved; there is still needless suffering by Nigerians, including workers. “Also parents still find it very difficult getting money even for transportation, and, there is general hunger and anger in the land,” the duo said. Both leaders said that the union would however, continue its consultations and mobilisation of  members and allies. According to them, this is in case its intervention on the side of the workers and masses after the general election become necessary. “We reiterate that the country is bigger than all those who hold political or administrative power, and insist that no one, institution or group is greater than Nigeria, and none is indispensable,“ the duo said.
