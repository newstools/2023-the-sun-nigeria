From LAYI OLANREWAJU, IlorinÂ  Residents of Alagbado , Okelele, Ayegbami, Dada and Oloje as well as adjoining communities abandoned their houses and scampered to safety as the huge smoke from the fire suggested that the fire might reached their places. The state governor, AbdulRahaman AbdulRazaq, visited the scene of the incident at about 11.45 pm to assess the situation of things and commiserated with the victims and residents of the area. It was gathered that the incident occurred at about 10 pm when a petroleum tanker was discharging fuel at MM filling station. Our correspondent was one of those that drew the attention of the spokesman of the state Fire Service, Hassan Adekunle to the incident and the agency responded to the distress call in good time. The firemen had a hectic time putting out the fire, but their quick response was applauded by the people who gathered from far and near to solidarize with those who reside in the vicinity of the scene of the fire outbreak. The Special Adviser on Strategy to Kwara State governor,Alh Saadu Salahu, whose private residence is located behind the burning filling station, expressed his appreciation to the state government and the firemen for their prompt interventions. Salahu, whose family were evacuated by neighbours thanked the security operatives and his private guard for their prompt responses. He equally thanked the people of the adjoining communities, family, friends and relations for their concerns and show of love while the nightmare lasted. The Special Adviser noted that were it not for the prompt intervention of the state government and the gallant firemen, the fire outbreak would have wreaked havoc of unimaginable proportion. Above all, Salahu thanked Allah for ensuring the safety of the lives of the people in the neighbourhood and his own family members as his residence is situated directly behind the burning filling station.
