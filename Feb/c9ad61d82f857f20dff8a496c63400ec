The Okpe Peoples Forum (OPF), a Pan-Okpe Socio-cultural and Political group has expressed confidence in the ability of Sheriff Oborevwori to bring rapid development to Delta and has backed his aspiration in the state’s March 11 governorship poll. The global group, made up of prominent Okpe sons and daughters across Nigeria and in the diaspora have appealed to all Deltans for their understanding and support and vote for Oborevwori as Okowa’s successor. In a statement signed by OPF President, Igho Akeregha and the Public Relations Officer, Austin Azu, the group noted that the People’s Democratic Party candidate possess the necessary capacity and experience to lead Delta state into a prosperous state having gone down in history as Speaker of the Delta State House of Assembly for a two term of eight years and ensured stability in the affairs of the Assembly. As Speaker of the House of Assembly, the Okpe group noted that Oborevwori has demonstrated uncommon managerial skills by promoting peace and cohesion thereby eliminating the usual rancour previously associated with the lawmakers. The group reminded Deltans that the PDP candidate is an Okpe who are well known for their peaceful coexistence with other ethnic groups in the state and have supported candidates from every part of the state to be governor. “While we do not hold that it is a matter of right for the Okpe to be supported as governor, we appeal to our fellow Deltans to give the Okpe a chance on Saturday in the interest of fairness, equity and justice”. The OPF said Oborevwori is a man who has spent all his life in the state and understands the peculiar needs of Deltans and would deliver quality governance across the three senatorial districts.
