Nollywood actress, Chantel Igwe has recalled her most embarrassing Valentine’s Day and how her lover broke her heart. According to the leggy, light skinned actress, the memory of what transpired that day will remain evergreen in her memory. She told Saturday Sun: “When I was in my third year in school, I had a boyfriend but who was in a different school. So, on Valentine’s Day, he invited me over to his place. His friends and family members knew we were dating. He sent money and everything I needed to come around and I went. I was in his house chilling when a lady walked in and asked to see him in private. He went outside with her to have a conversation. Later, he came back and told me he’s helping to write exam for the lady’s brother.” Igwe continued, “That same evening, we decided to hang out only to meet the same lady when we got back home. Again, they both stepped aside to have a discussion, and he gave the same excuse. Well, I stayed for a few days in his house and decided to go back to school. “On my way back home, I discovered I forgot something and had to head back to his house. Right there, I met him with the same lady in a very compromising position. I confronted him and he said the lady has been throwing herself at him. Things get me easily irritated, so I just dumped him despite his pleas. I can’t forget that day.” Chantel Igwe, who last week lost her dear mother, listed what she would be remembered for. “I feel sad, so sad that she left so soon. There are lots of things I would remember my mother for. She’s so strong, stronger than most men. She’s hard working, she engaged in different types of businesses to make sure her family survived.”
