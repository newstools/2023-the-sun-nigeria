Fast rising hip-hop act, Felix Philemon Sola, has released a new single titled, Busybody. Speaking shortly after the song hit the airwaves, Skillager, said: “I have always loved hip hop songs. I engaged in a lot of rap battles in my early days and I believe I can do a lot with rap and create amazing sounds. I kept on growing and discovering myself and I knew I could do more; that is the genesis of my new sound.  “I always want to pass a message with my sound because I believe music is a form of communication, so I create conscious sound. And in order not to be boring, I try to make it very engaging with a feel of Afro-fusion. I am still growing and I intend to discover more because it is also a learning process and you never know it all when it comes to creating music.” Commenting on the song’s title, Skillager, who is from the stable of Tree of Life Entertainment noted, “Busybody is a very special song to me because it is my first single for the year, and also because it’s been a while I put out a project since my last EP in 2020. It is a song that appreciates every beautiful African lady out there and I titled it Busybody because our women are blessed and we, the men, love it.” While assuring his teeming fans of a much more productive 2023, Sola stated, “This year is very special for me and I know it is going to be one of the biggest years of my career, because we are trying to build a whole community. I am looking forward to a wonderful year 2023 and I am sure we are all in this together with the fans, because without them, I won’t be here or even be able to do anything.” On why he signed Skillager, Chief Executive Officer, Tree of Life Entertainment, Irhuesogie Alexander Ogbewi aka Salt, described Skillager as a multitalented artiste. “Patience is one big tool that is very rare and I admire that in him. He is multitalented. I do not think there will be a time he will bore his fans because like his name implies, he is a man with many skills,” he said.
