By Daniel Kanu Despite challenges and threats that the 2023 election faces, the likelihood of conducting a free and fair election is possible if all stakeholders work together to ramp up efforts in ensuring that all identified threats are nipped in the bud. This was the submission of Akinbode Oluwafemi, Executive Director, Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa (CAPPA), at the media presentation of the report, 2023 General Elections – Challenges and Threats to Consolidating Democracy, on Thursday, February 9, 2023, in Lagos. The report was informed by recent developments in the political space and the sense of apathy and hope that continues to grow as the 2023 General elections approach.Oluwafemi said it is crucial for all stakeholders: government, INEC, security agencies, Civil Society and Tech Companies, including the media to take note of all emerging developments, particularly the challenges facing Nigeria’s democracy and the opportunities that exist to work together for a fair and credible election.The report x-rayed Nigeria’s tumultuous democratic history, from its independence in 1960 marked by military coups to the restoration of civilian rule in 1999.It also focused on the persistent challenges of electoral malpractices faced during previous elections, as well as the improvements in the country’s electoral landscape.Oluwafemi said many Nigerians have the feeling that the existing challenges in the country may impede a credible general election but the activist said there is hope with good collaboration by stakeholders.Said Oluwafemi “As you all know, years of misgovernance have resulted in despair, unrest and uprisings across the country, particularly in the NorthEast where the Boko Haram insurgency began, and in the South East where separatist tensions continue to run high.“This report, therefore, interrogates the various concerns, including logistical and administrative difficulties faced by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), and attacks on its facilities, the lingering fuel and cash scarcity, rising security challenges in the polity, the spread of misinformation and fake news, the manifestations of voter suppression, and likelihood of social unrest.“Alongside challenges to free and fair election, the report zeroed in on the steps taken by President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration to guarantee credible elections with specific focus on the Electoral Act of 2022.“It recognizes INEC’s efforts to improve elections through the adoption of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) and INEC Result Viewing Portal (IReV), and the largely successful voter registration managed by the Commission which captured 9.5 million new voters among others”.The report also targeted critical stakeholders and their role in guaranteeing a free and fair election according to Oluwafemi.On recommendations for the government the report advised leadership “To Utilize the days left to the elections to ramp up measures to flush out violent groups and secure villages and towns affected by insecurity.“To deploy adequate security for the smooth conduct of the general election whilst also ensuring that this does not affect ongoing efforts to contain activities of violent groups across the country.“To put heads together with the CBN, and other relevant stakeholders to resolve the lingering crises of fuel and cash scarcity capable of negatively impacting the logistical capacities of INEC and other important parties such as election monitors”.The report counseled INEC to ” To work with community watch persons and security agencies to deploy technology including drones to electronically track in real time the movement of all vehicles and boats used in conveying electoral personnel and materials to prevent their hijacking and diversion.”To put in place mechanisms for swift countermeasures to prevent bypassing and hacking of the BVAS and IREV platforms. Where necessary, it should leverage international support for this purpose.” To liaise with relevant government, intergovernmental and non-governmental agencies to agree on effective measures to ensure the participation of Internally Displaced Persons in the election. This can be done by developing a register which accurately maps the number, identity, status and location of displaced persons. For Security Agencies and Operatives the report recommended for them ”To promptly arrest electoral offenders and prosecute them to serve as a deterrent to other intending lawbreakers.“”To work together with local communities and vigilantes to safeguard environments and report unusual activities.“”The Inter-Agency Consultative Committee on Election Security (ICCES) should work with security agencies to identify persons of interest based on credible intelligence and ensure they are subjected to lawful surveillance during the electioneering period provided a court order authorizing such is secured.“”Violence often starts with allegations of bias, hence the INEC, the police and other security agencies must maintain utmost impartiality in the course of discharging their duties.And for the Media, Civil Society and Tech Companies the report obliged the “”To work together to monitor and dispel election-related fake news.“”To intensify sensitization and awareness programmes aimed at empowering voters with information on peacebuilding during elections, and the latest developments as regard electioneering processes in Nigeria in order to help them make informed decisions””.
