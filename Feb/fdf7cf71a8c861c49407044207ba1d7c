OGC Nice coach, Didier Digard has praised Terem Moffi after he scored his first goals for the Ligue 1 club in a big Derby win over AS Monaco. Moffi scored twice and delivered an assist for Nice to dump Monaco 3-0 Sunday night. It was the striker’s first goals since his transfer last month from another Ligue 1 club, FC Lorient. The Nice coach said he never doubted the quality of his new signing. “Once again, I never doubted him,” Digard said.  “The main thing is that he had the support of all his teammates and his coaches. We were aware of the situation and he could have had doubts, but he was able to work very calmly and feel the confidence everyone had in him.  “Today he was rewarded, but for me it’s normal.” Moffi has now scored 14 goals in Ligue 1 this season.
