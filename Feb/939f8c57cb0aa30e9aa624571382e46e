The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has paid the accumulated match bonuses of the nine-time African champions, Super Falcons after seven months after the completion of the tournament.  The seven-month was arguably one of the longest waits for the nine-time African champions to access their entitlements, after previous ugly episodes, including protests that greet the 2010 and 2016 African title wins. Multiple sources informed NigeriaFootball.ng this week that the NFF only paid bonuses for three wins recorded against Burundi, Botswana in the group stages and in quarterfinal duel with Cameroon. Randy Waldrum’s side finished fourth at WAFCON 2022 after a 1-0 defeat to Zambia in the third-place match, marking their worse ever outing in the history of the competition, losing a record three matches from six. The win against the Indomitable Lionesses guaranteed thanks to Rasheedat Ajibade’s solitary effort sealed the West Africans automatic ticket to a ninth consecutive Women’s World Cup campaign in Australia and New Zealand. However, the unfortunate defeats began with a 2-1 loss to archrivals South Africa in the opening match before Waldrum’s side capitulated against hosts Morocco on penalties after a frustrating 120 minutes ended in a 1-1 draw. The third defeat came against Zambia in the third place encounter no thanks to a first half own-goal from goalkeeper Chiamaka Nnadozie at Stade Mohammed V, Casablanca which condemned the team to a second medal-less outing. With this development, the Super Falcons can now fully focus on their preparation for the 2023 FIFA Women’s World Cup, beginning with their participation in the inaugural Revelation Cup in Leon, Mexico later this month. The four-nation tournament, involving the former African champions will hold from 15 to 23 February, also feature hosts Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, with the two latter teams also featuring in this summer’s global showpiece.
