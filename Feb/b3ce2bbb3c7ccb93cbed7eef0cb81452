From Paul Osuyi, Asaba  The Federal High sitting in Asaba, Delta State, on yesterday adjourned a suit challenging the eligibility of Delta State  Governorship candidate of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in the March 11, 2023 election, Sheriff Oborevwori for adoption. The court presided over by Justice F.O Olubanjo, adjourned the matter to February 22, 2023, for adoption of written addresses by counsels after the defense counsel closed his case. A former governorship aspirant, Novwie Ikie, had dragged Oborevwori,who is the current Speaker of the state House of Assembly, to court, challenging his eligibility on allegation of forged academic certificate, which he presented for the upcoming election. At yesterday’s court session, Oborevwori mounted the witness box for cross examination. The PDP candidate testified that he was the original owner of the contentious WAEC certificate being alleged to have been forged. Presenting relevant documents to buttress his point, the Speaker affirmed that he was born 1963 as against 1979. He, also, told the court that in an effort to correct the erroneous date of birth in his WAEC certificate, he swore to an affidavit and Deed Poll to correct the date.
