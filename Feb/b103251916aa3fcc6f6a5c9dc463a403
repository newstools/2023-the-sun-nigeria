• Urges him to advise affiliate unions rightly Minister of Labour and Employment, Sen. Chris Ngige has congratulated Comrade Joe Ajaero on his election as the President of the Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC). Ngige charged the new NLC President to always lead his members on the truthful path and by proper reportage during turbulent industrial relations periods. He stated these in a congratulatory message to the NLC on a successful 13th Quadrennial National Delegate Conference and Election of New Executives in Abuja. Ngige also congratulated NLC for a job well done on the peaceful and seamless Quadrennial National Delegate Conference that was held from February 7-8, 2023. The minister commended the serene atmosphere that pervaded the venue of the conference, as well as the hitch-free election, which produced the President and other executive members of the Congress. “The immense responsibilities and obligations that rest on Trade Union leaderships are aptly put in the quote by Samuel Gompers that ‘The trade union movement represents the organised economic power of the workers..It is in reality, the most potent and the most direct social insurance the workers can establish ‘. This also indicates trust reposed in the organised labour.” Ngige therefore charged Ajaero to give the right advice to his trade union affiliates even if unpalatable at the given time, adding that it would go a long way in easing out the burden of his leadership and paving a way for better understanding and progress.
