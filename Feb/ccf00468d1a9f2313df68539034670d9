From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The embattled Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, has described the call for his resignation from Labour Party (LP) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) as misplaced. He also dismissed the allegation from the PDP National Collation agents, Dino Melaye, that he allocated scores to parties is unfounded and irresponsible. Rotimi Lawrence Oyekanmi, the Chief Press Secretary to INEC Chairman, who responded to the demand from the two political parties, insisted that contrary to their insinuation, the results emanating from the states point to a free, fair and credible process. According to the statement, “the call by the LP and the PDP on the INEC Chairman, Mahmood Yakubu, to resign is misplaced. The allegation by Melaye that the INEC Chairman allocated scores to parties is unfounded and irresponsible. “At the same time, contrary to the insinuation by both parties, results emanating from the States point to a free, fair and credible process,” Oyekanmi noted in the statement. Admonishing the parties to follow legal means to redress their grievances, the statement continued that “There are laid down procedures for aggrieved parties or candidates to follow when they are dissatisfied about the outcome of an election. “Such procedures do not include calling on the INEC Chairman to resign or for the election to be cancelled. To be sure, aggrieved parties are free to approach the courts to ventilate their concerns and wait for the matter to be resolved. “Making inciting comments capable of causing violence or unrest is unacceptable. The 2023 General election processes are in their final stages of completion. It is only fair for aggrieved parties to allow the conclusion of the process and approach the courts with their evidences to pursue their cases,” he advised.
