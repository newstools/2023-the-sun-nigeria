Presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, yesterday, vowed to succeed the President Muhammadu Buhari. Tinubu said he was instrumental to the emergence of the current administration and will definitely take over after the expiration of the tenure of the present president. Speaking at the Freedom Park, Osogbo the Osun state capital in continuation of his campaign, Tibubu, who spoke in Yoruba for most of the time said “Awa la gbe won wo le awa na lama ropo won” meaning “we brought them to power and we will replace them.” Tinubu, while assuring that the ousted governor Gboyega Oyetola would return, said the current administration has shown it is incapable of handling the affairs of Osun. He accused the Ademola Adeleke government of encouraging violence adding that his supporters have been unleashing mayhem on members of the All Progressive Congress.  Tinubu said his administration would empower the people with the skill that will make them employable while ensuring that the youth will no longer spend years in university due to lecturers’ strike action, stating that his pledge to the people will remain a biding covenant. “I make a social covenant with you today that the unemployed among you will get job. Those with no skill will be provided the relevant skill that would put food on their table. When we get to government, we will make soft loans available for market women and business owners.”
