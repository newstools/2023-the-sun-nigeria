From Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja The African Democratic Congress ( ADC) has disassociated self from the call for cancellation of the general elections by the National Chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure, on behalf of the Labour Party, Peoples Democratic Party and the African Democratic Congress. ADC Board of Trustees Chairman, Senator Patricia Akwashiki made this known in a statement released to journalists in Abuja,on Tuesday. She appealed to the other parties to absent ADC from their fight adding that the  party can not  involved itself with any action that would affect the unity of the country. “My attention has been drawn to a press statement issued by the National Chairman of the Labour Party, Julius Abure, on behalf of the Labour Party, Peoples Democratic Party and the African Democratic Congress. They demanded that the INEC Chairman step down from his position and that fresh elections should be conducted. This is not the position of the African Democratic Congress (ADC). Ralph Nwosu who is the immediate past Chairman of the ADC does not speak for the ADC and cannot speak for the ADC. We cannot be party to any action that will undermine the integrity of INEC or lead to a breakdown of law and order. When the final results are announced by INEC, we will have an informed reaction. The ADC will not be a party to any attempt to truncate the ongoing electoral process. All parties to this process must remain law abiding and remember that the Electoral Act clearly spells out guidelines for redress, she said.
