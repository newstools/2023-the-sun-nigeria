Spanish La Liga club, Atletico Madrid, has entered the race to sign Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen from Napoli. The Nigerian international has been on the priority list of top European clubs following his outstanding display for the Parthenopeans so far this season. The Nigerian has attracted greater interest from football scouts owing to his 18 goals in 19 league games and recent records. The 24-year-old striker, who reached 100 Club-record goals before Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi in his early career, has piqued the interest of top Premier League clubs like Manchester United and Chelsea, who are looking to bolster their attack. Although Napoli president, Aurelio De Laurentiis, has publicly announced that the Key striker is not for sale, and also planning to increase his salary in an effort to put a stop to any attempts to lure the striker away from Diego Maradona Stadium. However, with an increased offer of selling Romelu Lukaku plus cash to the Parthenopeans, Chelsea has shown resolute determination to get the striker. Meanwhile, according to IL Maltino, the Spanish club, Atlético Madrid are in the mix to capture the Super Eagles’ talisman after their scouts were spotted keeping an eye on him during Napoli’s match against Sassuolo. It would be difficult to retain the Super Eagles player in Naples for an extended period, given the offers that are now on the table and the height of Osimhen’s career. However, with his contract with the Gli Azzurri to expire in two years’ time and Napoli signing him from LOSC Lille for a bid in the region of €50 million, now could be the best moment to make a lot of money off of him.
