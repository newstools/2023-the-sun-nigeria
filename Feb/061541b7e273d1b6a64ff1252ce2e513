From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Abia State governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Ikechi Emenike said he is contesting the March 11 governorship election to rescue the state from its present state of decadence if he wins. Emenike stated this at his Umukabia-country home in Umuahia North Local Government Area, during an interactive session with journalists which he used to unveil his manifesto titled, “The Emenike Movement…to rescue and develop Abia State”. Lamenting the numerous problems bedeviling the state, the APC governoship candidate attributed bad leadership as the bane of Abia. “All is not well with Abia State; the air, trees, birds and other things are complaining about the ills of the state. Abia has gotten to the bottom of the pit and still sinking deeper, but we will have to bring it out from the pit. “Abia was not created to be the way it is, we are going to have a change. Our mission is to rescue Abia first, after which we talk about development. “If Nigeria persists in its underdevelopment, I shall determinedly lead the charge for the emergence of a first world state, even in a third world country”, Emenike stated. The APC governorship candidate who made it clear that peace has returned to Abia APC, said if he wins the election, he will give Local Governments in the state financial autonomy. On the issue of security vote, Emenike who said the idea was new in Nigeria, promised to do away with it in the state if elected governor of the state. Regretting that Abia was the only state in the South East geopolitical zone without air, Emenike promised to establish an international airport in Abia if he becomes governor of the state. He expressed optimism that Bola Ahmed Tinubu will win the presidential poll, and promised of better Nigeria ahead.
