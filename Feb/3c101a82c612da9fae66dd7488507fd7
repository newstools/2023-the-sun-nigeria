From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has hinted that it will likely postpone Enugu East senatorial election by two weeks over the alleged murder of Labour Party (LP) senatorial candidate, Oyibo Chukwu. Citing Section 34 of the Electoral Act, chairman of the commission, Mahmood Yakubu, however said that such postponement and relevant section of the Electoral Act can only be activated if the political party involved officially notifies the commission. Oyibo, a lawyer, was allegedly attacked and murdered while returning from a campaign trip. He was said to have been burnt inside his vehicle, along some persons. However, reacting to it, the electoral umpire boss said: “there are procedures to handling such issue. In such situation, the commission will have to countermind the senatorial district for two weeks. The section can 9nly be activated if the party involved officially notifies the commission.” Section 34(b) stipulates that in the case of election into a legislative House, the election shall start afresh and the political party whose candidate died may, if it intends to continue to participate in the election, conduct a fresh primary within 14 days of the death of its candidate and submit the name of a new candidate to the Commission to replace the dead candidate: “Provided that in the case of presidential or gubernatorial or Federal Capital Territory Area Council election, the running mate shall continue with the election and nominate a new running mate,” the section read.
