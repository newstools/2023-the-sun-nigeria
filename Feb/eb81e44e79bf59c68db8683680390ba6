NANS JCC, a Lagos-based affiliate of the National Association of Nigerian Students, has berated a group of land speculators in Lagos, who recently invaded the premises of Shalom Group of Schools, Baruwa, Ipaja area of Lagos metropolis. Describing the incident as “heinous, barbaric, unacceptable,” Chairman of NAN JCC Lagos axis, Comrade Tolulope Olusesi, in a statement made available to Sunday Sun warned that the despicable act threatened the lives of the students whose learning activities were also disrupted in the process. Olusesi who likened the ignoble incident to a slap in the face of the Lagos State government, which granted the necessary approvals to the school, called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, as the chief educator in the state, to take legal steps to bring the miscreants to justice. “The wellness and mental stability of students is important in an academic environment, as an attempt to vandalise such sector can leave long-lasting impression of trauma, fear and insecurity in the students. “We cannot afford to jeopardise the lives of Nigerian students. Since the incident occurred, the students of Shalom Group of Schools, have been put at risk of lagging behind, uncertain about returning to classes soon,” Olusesi said.
