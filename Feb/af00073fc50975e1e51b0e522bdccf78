The United States Government has said that Nigeria’s upcoming general elections matter not only to Nigerians but also to the rest of the world. In a video message to Nigerians by the United States Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, and other senior administration officials, the United States said Nigeria’s constitution, like America’s, begins with a simple and profound idea, ‘We the People.’ “And during this election, you, the people of Nigeria, have a chance to make your voices heard, to choose your future. “The United States does not support any individual candidate for office, but we strongly support a peaceful election that reflects the will of the people of Nigeria because free and fair elections in Nigeria help create a freer and fairer world for everyone. “Your vote matters, this election matters, not only to Nigerians but to the rest of the world. We’re invested in your success. Our shared democratic futures depend on it,” the United States officials said. While urging Nigerians to visit INEC website www.INECNigeria.org to prepare to vote, the senior United States officials further said the Nigerian people have a friend and partner in the United States of America.
