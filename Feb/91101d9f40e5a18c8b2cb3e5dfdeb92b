•Osimhen-mania catches on in Napoli as fans cop memorabilia Napoli fans are so in love with Victor Osimhen that they are not only queuing to buy his shirt but also replicas of his protective mask outside the Stadio Maradona, reports La Gazzetta dello Sport. The Nigeria international is Serie A’s leading scorer with 17 goals in 18 matches, including eight in the last six appearances. He bagged one in Sunday’s 3-0 win against Cremonese and Gazzetta reports the Partenopei supporters are so in love with their star that they even queue to buy replicas of the protective mask he’s been wearing for more than a year following a cheekbone injury suffered against Inter in November 2021. Replicas of Osimhen’s mask are on sale in the stalls outside the stadium and hundreds of fans were seen queuing to buy the gadget on Sunday, before their game with Cremonese. The pink describes Osimhen as the ‘king of Naples’ with the Partenopei dreaming of winning their first title in over 30 years.
