Super Eagles forwards, Victor Osimhen and Ademola Lookman have been nominated for January’s Serie A player of the month award. The two Nigerian attackers delivered several spectacular performances in the colors of their respective clubs. Osimhen scored five goals and supplied an assist in five league matches played in January. After he was caged in the loss to Inter Milan at the San Siro, Osimhen became unstoppable as he found the net in Napoli’s victories over Sampdoria, Juventus, Salernitana and Roma. The highlight of his feats was the brilliant brace and assist he notched in the 5-1 demolition of Juventus at the Diego Maradona Stadium. While Osimhen was pulling the strings for Napoli, Ademola Lookman was matching his compatriot’s exploits at Atalanta. Please enable JavaScript This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window.

After firing blanks against Spezia on January 4, Lookman sparked back to life with consecutive braces against Salernitana and Juventus, a match where he contributed all of Atalanta’s goals in a thrilling 3-3 away draw. And last weekend, the former Leicester City winger netted a stunning strike to help Atalanta secure a 2-0 win at home to Sampdoria. Inter Milan’s Lautaro Martinez, AS Roma’s Paolo Dybala and Lazio’s Luis Alberto are the other players nominated alongside Osimhen and Lookman for the prestigious award.
