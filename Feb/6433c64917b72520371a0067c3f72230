The Department of State Services (DSS) has released the former minister for Aviation and spokesperson of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council, Chief Femi Fani-Kayode. Fani-Kayode, who was invited on Monday morning, following his allegation of plotting a coup during the upcoming general elections, was released after spending over six hours with the secret police at the DSS headquarters in Abuja. APC PCC spokesperson, who confirmed his release on Twitter, said he was on his way home this evening. “I’ve been released. I’m on my way home. I’m going to address the press on the matter. Everything is under control,” he said. The DSS announced earlier in the day that it had invited the former aviation minister to its office in Abuja. DSS public relations officer who made this known in a statement said “Chief Femi Fani-kayode has been with the DSS since 9am today 13/02/23…in response to the invitation extended to him by the Service.”
