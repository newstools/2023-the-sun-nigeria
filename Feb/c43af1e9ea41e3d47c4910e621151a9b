From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure Ondo State Governor Mr Rotimi Akeredolu has urged President Muhammadu Buhari to direct the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr Godwin Emefiele, to reverse the naira redesign policy with immediate effect. Governor Akeredolu said that both the new and old naira notes should be allowed to co-exist, noting that despite an existing court injunction, the old notes seem to have ceased to be legal tender in the country. The Governor spoke in Akure, the state capital while receiving members of the Youths directorate of the All Progressive Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) led by Mr Seyi Tinubu, who is the son of APC Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Governor Akeredolu faulted the timing of the policy, stating that it is ill-timed, adding that the problem created by the naira and fuel scarcity has affected the ratings of the APC. He said ”We have a problem we are facing in this country today. Our rating as a party is not favourable. Let’s not deceive ourselves. Must it be now that we will have this financial policy? “Things are not easy. This policy is not right at this time. It should be reversed. Reserve it and tell CBN that we are reversing it. Let old and new notes co-exist. “There is an injunction and everyone is behaving like there is no injunction. We have said that this man (CBN Governor) should be removed when he contested to be President. The man is not fit for that position. A man who attempted to be President will frustrate us at this time.” Governor Akeredolu commended Seyi Tinubu and his team for the rigorous campaign embarked upon for the success of the APC. While appreciating the youths in the party for their relentless efforts, the Governor revealed that youth will determine the outcome of the next week presidential election.
