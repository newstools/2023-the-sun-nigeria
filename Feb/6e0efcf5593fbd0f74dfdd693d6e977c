Ladan Bosso has heaped praises on Egypt following Flying Eagles’ 1-0 victory in the TotalEnergies U-20 Africa Cup of Nations on Wednesday, BSNSports.com.ng has gathered. Nigeria secured its first points of the tournament after their shock defeat to Senegal at the Cairo International Stadium in the opening round of matches. Solomon Agbalaka headed in from a corner in the last 20 minutes to give the seven times champions all 3 points against a wasteful Young Pharaohs who created numerous chances in the Group A clash. “Wednesday’s match was full of tactics, more than the Senegal match,” Bosso said after the match. “The Egyptian national team is very good and they had many opportunities, but they did not take advantage of them. “But in the end, football is changing and most of the time you cannot predict the result,” he added. “The result is very important and I don’t think I can say more than that. We focused a lot on winning and we achieved what we wanted.” Nigeria’s victory sends them to second place behind Senegal who has already qualified following their 3-0 win over Mozambique. The seven-time champions of the TotalEnergies U-20 Africa Cup of Nations will be seeking another opportunity to qualify for the FIFA U-20 World Cup. “Any player who strives deserves to join the first team. Our main goal is to reach the World Cup, and we strive hard to achieve this goal,” Bosso said.
