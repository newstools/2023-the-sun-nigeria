The Federal Government has directed all federal polytechnics in the country to temporarily shut down ahead of the 2023 general elections. A memo addressed to the Executive Secretary, National Board for Technical Education (NBTE), Idris Muhammad Bugaje, on behalf of the Minister of Education, Mallam Adamu Adamu, reminded him that the 2023 general elections have been scheduled for February 25th and March 11th. The minister stated in the memo: “In view of concerns expressed on the security of staff, students and property of our respective institutions, the Minister of Education, Adamu Adamu, has, following extensive consultations with the relevant security agencies, directed that all polytechnics be shut down and academic activities are suspended between Wednesday 22nd February and Tuesday 14th March 2023. “You are to communicate the above to all the institutions under your regulatory functions. It’s necessary to inform them so that appropriate adjustments are made in their academic calendar to accommodate this three weeks loss.” Last week, the National Universities Commission (NUC) issued similar directives to Vice Chancellors of Federal Universities, asking them to shut down the campuses for three weeks to enable students to participate in the coming elections.
