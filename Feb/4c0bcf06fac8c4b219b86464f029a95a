My Dear Compatriots, a. The need to restore the statutory ability of the CBN to keep a firm control over money in circulation. In 2015 when this administration commenced its first term, Currency-in-Circulation was only N1.4trillion. b. The proportion of currency outside banks grew from 78%in 2015 to 85% in 2022. As of October 2022, therefore, currency in circulation had risen to N3.23 trillion; out of which only N500 billion was within the Banking System while N2.7 trillion remained permanently outside the system; thereby distorting the financial policy and efficient management of inflation; c. The huge volume of Bank Notes outside the banking system has proven to be practically unavailable for economic activities and by implication, retard the attainment of potential economic growth; d. Economic growth projections make it imperative for government to aim at expanding financial inclusion in the country by reducing the number of the unbanked population; and e. Given the prevailing security situation across the country, which keeps improving, it also becomes compelling for government to deepen its continuing support for security agencies to successfully combat banditry and ransom-taking in Nigeria a. A strengthening of our macro economic parameters; b. Reduction of broad money supply leading to a deceleration of the velocity of money in the economy which should result in less pressures on domestic prices; c. Lowering of Inflation as a result of the accompanying decline in money supply that will slow the pace of inflation; d. Collapse of Illegal Economic Activities which would help to stem corruption and acquisition of money through illegal ways; e. Exchange Rate stability; f. Availability of Easy Loans and lowering of interest rates; and g. Greater visibility and transparency of our financial actions translating to efficient enforcement of our anti- money laundering legislations. Thank you for listening. God bless the Federal Republic of Nigeria.
