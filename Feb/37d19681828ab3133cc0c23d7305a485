English Premier League side, Southampton has revealed jersey numbers for their new signings including Genks and Super Eagles striker, Paul Onuachu. Southampton left it late on transfer deadline day but eventually managed to secure the signings of Rennes forward Kamaldeen Sulemana and Genk striker, Onuachu Sulemana arrived for a record-breaking fee from Rennes first, before 6ft 7ins Nigerian striker, Onuachu was signed from Genk shortly after. Both moves mean Saints are now well stacked in forward areas, which was always the key area that manager Nathan Jones wanted to improve his side in during the window. Neither player has had a chance to pose with a Southampton shirt yet as their medicals were not complete abroad, nor do fans know which numbers both players will wear. Onuachu, who consistently wore the number 18 shirt during his time at Genk, kept the same squad number for his entire time in Belgian. Unfortunately, he won’t be able to keep the same shirt at Saints, with Sekou Mara currently in possession of the 18 jersey. He also wore the number 33 for FC Midtjylland before joining Genk, while at international level he regularly wears the number 19 for Nigeria. With 19 already taken by Djenepo, it could mean Onuachu takes the currently vacant 33 shirt, which hasn’t been used since Matt Targett left the club in 2019. Other numbers available are five, 12, 16, 20, 25, 29 and 30.
