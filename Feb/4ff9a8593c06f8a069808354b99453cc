From Fred Itua, Abuja  Opposition Coalition spokesperson Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere has raised alarm and accused the Governor of Imo State, Hope Uzodimma of still plotting to rig the 2023 general elections.  He alleged the plot to compromise the recruitment of INEC Adhoc staff, particularly those that will be in charge of ensuring that the BVAS machine works. He brandished a list he said was the names of the APC trained people who are supposed to be in charge of the RACTECHS. He said the list will be enclosed and delivered to reliable courier companies and would be mailed to media houses when the posting is done to so as to confirm to Nigerians that the intelligence at his disposal about the compromise was credible. He further fingered the Imo State Government for blocking investigation into the voter registration compromise popularly called Omuma Magic which he revealed sometime in September last year.  He said despite the evidence now in public domain and petitions to the relevant government agencies, no investigation has been done and the Imo State Government has been working over time to ensure there is no investigation. The opposition spokesperson hailed the INEC Chairman, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu for conducting internal investigation and identifying at least twenty-five of its staff who were involved in the Omuma Magic and are currently facing disciplinary actions in the Commission. Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere also called on President Muhammadu Buhari to demand from the heads of security agencies an investigation report of his allegations in other to prove that there are people in government who are bent on sabotaging the effort of the President to fulfill his promise of bequeathing Nigerians with a free, fair and credible 2023 election.
