Eze Ndigbo Ifako Ijaiye, Lagos State, Eze Michael Ezekwobi, has called on the Federal Government to take urgent measures to mitigate the impact of the naira scarcity on citizens to allow greater participation of the electorate in the upcoming general elections. In a statement, yesterday, Eze Ezekwobi who recently celebrated his 22nd year on the throne as Eze Igbo Ifako Ijaiye also tasked the Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) and relevant agencies to ensure peaceful conduct of the polls. He lamented that Nigerians were  going through serious hardship due to the scarcity of the naira and said measure should be taken urgently to avoid the breakdown of law and order in the country. He, however, commended the judiciary for rising to the occasion through the  Supreme Court  rulings on the deadline for Naira redesign, saying  the judiciary remains the last hope of the common man. He said as cultural leader of Ndigbo in Ifako Ijaye, he has promoted peace and orderliness between the Igbo and their host community. He urged the Igbo in Ifako Ijayie to come out enmass and use their PVCs to vote in candidates of their choices on the  election dates.
