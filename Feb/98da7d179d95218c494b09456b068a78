Luciano Spalletti hails ‘an imperious show of strength’ from 10-man Napoli to win 2-0 in Empoli, explains why Super Eagles striker, Victor Osimhen is ‘a leader.’ The Partenopei notched up their 20th win in the last 21 Serie A rounds to consolidate top spot, as Ardian Ismajli scored an own goal on Piotr Zielinski’s low cross before Osimhen turned in the rebound from a Guglielmo Vicario save on Kvicha Kvaratskhelia. The Nigerian also had a goal ruled offside and Kim Min-jae’s header came off the crossbar, but the perfect performance was ruined by Mario Rui’s red card for a reaction foul as he kicked Francesco Caputo in the crotch. Spalletti made only one change from the side that beat Eintracht Frankfurt 2-0 in the Champions League midweek. Osimhen found the net for the eighth Serie A match in a row, but Spalletti revealed something that happened during the half-time break with Napoli already 2-0 up.  “At the end of the first half, he was a little angry with me as well going into the break as I had told him off. The first thing he said was, hey, don’t forget what happened last season. Osimhen is a leader, he has the right mentality, the desire to work with the collective and fight for the result,” Spalletti told DAZN.  “That can also damage him, because once again today he had a couple of chances that he didn’t take because he was tired from having worked so hard just before that.” Last term, Napoli had been leading 2-0 at the Stadio Castellani only to lose 3-2.
