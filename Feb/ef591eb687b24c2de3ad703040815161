By Christopher OjiÂ  There was pandemonium at Ojota, Mile 12, and Ketu ,Lagos as hundreds of protesters barricaded the roads. The protesters were protesting the scarcity of Naira notes in the city. The protesters barricaded the roads and made bonfire with used tyres. Following the protesters, many vehicles whose drivera refused to make a detour as directed by the protesters were smashed. However, a contingent of Soldiers from OP Messa and Policemen were deployed to the areas to disperse the protesters. Many people were injured during a stampede when the security agencies were throwing teargas and shooting into the air. Lagos State Police Publlic Relations Officer, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said normalcy has returned to the area. Details later.
