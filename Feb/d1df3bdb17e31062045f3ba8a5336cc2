By Bimbola Oyesola The International Labour Organization (ILO) on Friday said more than 200 million workers live in absolute poverty, emphasizing the need for a strong and sustained dose of social justice in the world. In a statement to celebrate World Day of Social Justice, ILO director-general, Gilbert F. Houngbo, called for global momentum to contribute to the reduction and prevention of inequalities. “Today, we mark the World Day of Social Justice. We do so in difficult circumstances. The impact of COVID-19, combined with geopolitical turmoil, an economic crisis and natural disasters, has pushed social progress backwards,” he said. He noted that a look at current labour market trends showed that the picture is grim. According to him, the global employment growth will be only 1.0 percent in 2023, less than half the level of 2022. He said, “Enterprises, especially small and micro-enterprises, have been hard hit. “So, what the world needs now is a strong and sustained dose of social justice which is key to fair, peaceful societies.” In order to promote decent work, such as access to jobs, rights at work, social protection, and social dialogue, the Director General said the International Labour Organization aims to launch in 2023 a Global Coalition for Social Justice. “We want to create a global momentum to contribute to the reduction and prevention of inequalities, and to ensure that social justice is prioritized in national and global policymaking and activities, in development cooperation and in financial, trade and investment agreements,” he said. He maintained that the idea is to ensure that no one is left behind. “So, amid crisis I do think there is reason to hope – if we come together to pursue social justice,” he stated.
