Arsenal FC goalkeeper, Arthur Okonkwo has disclosed that he got his height from his Nigerian parents. The 21-year-old is one of the tallest goalkeepers in Europe as he stands at 6ft and 6in (1,98 meters) and he is currently on loan at Austrian Bundesliga side Sturm Graz. Okonkwo, who was born in London, England, opened up about his height after keeping a clean sheet on debut as Graz defeated Rapid Vienna 1-0 in a league match on Friday.  “I got my height from my parents. My father is 1.96 meters tall and my mother is 1.70 meters tall. Both are from Nigeria,” Okonkwo said to Kleine Zeitung.  “I played briefly on the field, otherwise always as a goalkeeper. I’ve always had a lot of fun with saves.  “And my size is certainly not a disadvantage either.” Okonkwo represented England at under-16 and under-17 levels, and then debuted for the under-18s two days before his 18th birthday. The former Crewe Alexandra keeper, whose middle name is Chukwuezugo, remains eligible for Nigeria, too, through his family descent.
