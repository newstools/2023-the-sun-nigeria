From Lateef Dada, Osogbo The Oluwo of Iwoland in Osun State, Oba Abdurosheed Akanbi, has appealed to the youths not to destroy peoples’ property in protest against the scarcity of new naira. The monarch in a statement by his press secretary, Alli Ibrahim, on Friday, commended the youth of the state for maintaining peace and order despite the hardship inflicted on innocent masses by the new naira regime. He said, “while acknowledging your peace-loving spirit, I appeal for further calm, orderliness, and protection of both public and private properties. Our banks and their workers are not at fault. Don’t touch them. “There is no such infrastructure in Osun. Let’s protect our state against the infrastructural deficit. Don’t destroy banks. Whatever we do to public and private properties will have a huge effect on our collective economy,” he added. The monarch, however, called on the Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government to consider the suffering masses and halt the new naira policy.
