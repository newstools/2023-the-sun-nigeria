From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja  Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Presidential Campaign Council ( PCC) has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) of allegedly manipulating the result of the February 25 presidential poll in Ebonyi and Imo states. The PCC Director of Strategic Communications, Dele Momodu, stated this, at a  press briefing, on Monday in Abuja. Momodu said from the collated data, the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is leading in the contest. Consequently, he noted that the APC is allegedly mounting pressure on officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC) in Imo and Ebonyi so as to secure 25 percent of votes cast in the two states. However, he stated that the PDP candidate has already scored 25 percent of the votes in about 24 states across the country. According to him, “from already collated results data, we are proud to inform Nigerians that the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP) remains in the lead in the election of last weekend. “We remain the only political party which has secured the necessary 25 per cent spread across 24 states in the country. No other political party has been able to cross this essential constitutional requirement. “From our standpoint, the APC has no justifiable path to winning this election. Unlike the PDP, the APC lacks the spread and unlike the PDP, the figures are not adding up for them.”
