The Adamawa State Government, has distributed water pumping, sewing and welding machines, to about 492 cooperative societies and three correctional centers, in its efforts towards empowering citizens. Gov. Ahmadu Fintiri, who was represented by the state’s Head of Service (HOS), Mr Edger Amos, disclosed this on Tuesday, at the opening of the third phase of the empowerment programme in Yola. Fintiri said some of the beneficiaries would also receive electric generators, hair clippers, hair hand dryers, carpentry tool boxes, chicks and materials for poultry farmers. He said the cooperative societies had been trained on handling the tools, aimed at ensuring citizens’ self reliance, as well as boosting the economy of the state. The governor added that the programme was being implemented by the state’s Ministry of Entrepreneurship Development. Speaking at the event, the Commissioner of Entrepreneurship Development, Mr James Iliya, said additional empowerment starter packs would be distributed according to the nature of the business of a particular cooperative society. According to Iliya, the ministry is aware of the important roles artisans and cooperative societies play towards the development of small scale and medium businesses. The Commissioner said that the programme  was also being fully implemented at the Mubi, Yola and Numan correctional centers, where inmates were being trained on different vocational skills. “The initiative was aimed at supporting reformation, rehabilitation and reintegration of inmates after they might have finished serving their jail terms,” Iliya said. In his remarks, the Controller of Adamawa State Correctional Centers Haliru Nabah, appreciated the gesture, saying the initiative would aid in reforming the inmates. (NAN)
