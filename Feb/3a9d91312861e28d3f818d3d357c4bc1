From TONY JOHN, Port Harcourt The Rivers Governorship Debate group has advised politicians that election is not about violence, but vote casting for a popular and chosen candidate to emerge victorious. Chairman of the group, Ibifiri Bobmanuel, gave the advise on Thursday, when he briefed journalists on their preparedness for 2023 debate with the governorship candidates in Rivers State, scheduled for Sunday, at the Hotel Presidential, Port Harcourt. Bobmanuel disclosed that the governorship candidates in the state had expressed willingness to participate in the exercise, hinting that there would be representatives from the National Peace Committee and international community, who are part of the peace process. He emphasized on the need to have a peaceful election, stating that Rivers Governorship Debate group is interested in discussing issue-based topics rather than violence. Bob-Manuel said since 2015, when Rivers Debate was conceptualized, the peace of the state has remained paramount and should be sustained. He said: “We would be discussing issues this time because the whole focus and vision behind the Rivers Debate has always been on issues rather than violence; because when you leave the space for issues, the only other space you have would obviously be violence and rancour. “We think Rivers State is too important for us to allow it slide down to that direction. That’s why we have put together the Rivers Debate 2023.” According to him, the governorship candidates would be made to sign a peace pact, so that the forthcoming elections would violent-free. “It is very important that they (governorship candidates) sign the peace accord, so they refrain, not just themselves, but their supporters to the issues of the day and issues of the event, which is all about electioneering. And anything that would obviously not go down well.”
