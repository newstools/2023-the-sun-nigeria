D’Tigers of Nigeria last night registered a second consecutive win at the ongoing last window of the FIBA Basketball World Cup African Qualifiers in Luanda, Angola with a 62-59 win over Guinea. Nigeria rallied back in the last quarter of the game to crawl back to take the game from a rampaging Guinea side that kept an even score of 13-13 in the first quarter, 22-18 and 18-13 in the second and third quarters respectively but outscored Guinea by 23-11. Victor Ezeh scored 12 points to lead the floor for the Nigeria side while Cheick Sekou Conde scored 25 points.  The result means that Nigeria won the game and their hope of qualifying for the World Cup is still alive.  Ahead of the Nigeria’s last game today against host Angola, Nigeria would need to dig deep to win. Coach Ogoh Odaudu admits that the game will be an uphill task but that he and his wards are not letting the home crowd deter them. “We know our game against Angola will be tough given the home crowd and their boisterous support for their side such that you can hardly hear the person next to you. But we won’t allow it deter us because we want to make it three straight wins.”
