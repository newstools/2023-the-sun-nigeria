The Enugu State Commissioner of Police, Ahmed Ammani, has warned that the State Police Command will not tolerate lapses of any kind from the officers and men of the Command before, during and after Saturday’s general election in the state. The police chief ordered the maximum deployment of all policing resources in the state for the election. This, according to the State Police Public Relations Officer, Daniel Ndukwe (DSP), is in furtherance of the CP’s avowed commitment to ensure a peaceful and credible 2023 General Elections in Enugu State. CP Ammani gave the orders while addressing the Officers during a last-minute Elections Security Review and Strategisation Meeting with the Command’s Management Team (CMT) members and Commanders of all the Tactical and Operational Formations/Units in the Command, in his Office on Tuesday. At the meeting, which was aimed at putting the finishing touches to the strategies being put in place for the maintenance of law and order during the period of the Presidential and National Assembly Elections, on Saturday, the State Police boss charged the Supervisory Officers to “ensure that all the Command’s human, operational and intelligence assets at their disposal are maximally deployed towards the provision of adequate security for the electorate and other authorised participants in the Elections.” Ndukwe said that the CP also ordered them to ensure that the Election Centres and flashpoints are adequately policed to forestall untoward occurrences. He further said, “Meanwhile, the Commissioner has maintained that the Police will leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the Elections are conducted as expected, under an atmosphere of peace, security and safety of the citizenry. He, therefore, urges all and sundry in State to remain vigilant, law-abiding and supportive.”
