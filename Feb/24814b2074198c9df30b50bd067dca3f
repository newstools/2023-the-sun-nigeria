Singer and content creator, Adebisi Emmanuel Adetayo also known as Bisimanuel, said he wouldn’t have emerged one of Nigeria’s music sensations in less than three years without having a ‘special calling’. From making covers to creating short Instagram music videos and a growing fan base, Bisimanuel believes his time has come to make a mark in the music industry. “I feel no pressure even though, I ask myself sometimes how I manage to put myself into all the commitments I have. But then, I am reminded that God’s special grace has carried me for years and will not leave me at this point,” he quipped. On how he discovered his passion for music, he said: “I discovered early that people love the way I sing. I just want to express what I think about different spheres of life via this mode. In the early days of creating content, those who did this before me had inspired me. Someone like EmmaohmyGod and other creative people online helped me a lot.”
