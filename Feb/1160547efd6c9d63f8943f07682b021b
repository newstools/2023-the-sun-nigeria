…Vinicius Junior too La Liga has announced it has filed three complaints after perpetrators responsible for racially abusing Real Madrid’s Vinicius Junior and Villareal’s Samuel Chukwueze were identified. The Athletic previously reported that La Liga would file a complaint to the Pamplona court after Vinicius Junior was subjected to racist abuse during his side’s 2-0 win over Osasuna last Saturday. The Spanish organisation has now confirmed the complaint has been filed, along with two more additional complaints regarding Vinicius Jr suffering racist abuse against Mallorca on February 5, and Chukwueze suffering racist abuse during Villareal’s game against Mallorca on February 18. La Liga said: “The police have taken a statement from the individual identified by the director of security at RCD Mallorca as the person responsible for the racist insults against Villarreal CF player, Samu Chukwueze on Saturday February 18, who, in turn, has been identified as the person responsible for the racist chants against Vinicius Jr. on February 5 from the same stand at the Estadi Mallorca Son Moix.  “These two complaints have been lodged with the Courts of Instruction in Palma de Mallorca.” Racism in La Liga has been an issue brought to the forefront in recent weeks, especially with Vinicius Junior who has been the victim of several instances of racist abuse. His manager, Carlo Ancelotti came out and addressed the issue last month when he said: “Vinicius is the victim of something I don’t understand.  “It is a problem of Spanish football and I am part of Spanish football and it is a problem that we have to solve.” La Liga referring these incidents to courts represents a change in its procedure for these matters, in its fight against racism and homophobia. Previously, insults against all groups were transferred to the Anti-Violence Commission, whether one person, ten or an entire stand made them. In recent months La Liga has decided to go directly to the court.
