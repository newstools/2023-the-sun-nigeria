A new wave is blowing across the Nigerian music scene and the artiste responsible for this is Tony Nectar, who just released a new album titled, Love Each Other. According to a statement from his management, “Nobody can stop reggae. The music never stops. Tony Nectar has joined the global reggae community and has promised to give Africa a voice as his album hits the global market.  “Tony Nectar has a strong desire to achieve a position of importance in the world of reggae. Many of his songs are politically, religiously and socially motivated. Tony Nectar is spiritual, political and positive just like Robert Nesta Marley.” An educationist and soulful singer, Tony Nectar was born on January 15, 1968 in the Bum-Ahafo region of Ghana, but he is a native of Idoma, Benue State. Commenting on his music, Nectar said: “I try to promote unity between Islam and Christianity. I draw my inspiration from my diverse knowledge of the Bible, Quran and Torah. My music is for both young and old, black and white. I preach love and I detest political and religious violence, hence I am calling on all Nigerians especially the youths to avoid being instruments to destabilisation and anarchy, as we prepare for the general elections.” Songs in the album include Be Satisfied, Change The Situation, See Us Through, Slow and Steady, Save Our Souls, Love Each Other, My Kind of Music, Long Time, Ire, Black Race Redemption, True Love, and Wake Up Compatriots among others. Tony Nectar’s music is available for streaming and download on digital distribution stores worldwide, including leading music outlets nationwide.
