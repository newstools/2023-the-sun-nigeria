From Desmond Mgboh, Kano  The Department of State Services (DSS) has warned political parties and their supporters in Kano State to desist from engaging in activities that are capable of undermining peace in the state. Head of Operations, Kano State DSS, Alhassan Musa Tiffi, gave the warning at a stakeholders meeting organised by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the state yesterday. He insisted that the Service would not fold its arms and watch criminal elements hide under the pretext of politics to constitute themselves into threats to the peace of the state. He said the Service was aware of the upward climb in the activities of thuggery, which has manifested in the destruction of public property and billboards of rivals. He said the Service as a strategic intelligence gathering organ of government was alive to its responsibilities and would, alongside sister security organs, take strategic steps to arrest such culprits. The Director, Centre For Democratic Studies, Mumbayya House, Kano, Professor Habu Fagge, frowned at the absence of political parties at the strategic meeting, which he said was crucial to the success of the forthcoming general election in the state. In his remarks, Kano Resident Electoral Commissioner, Amb Abdul Zango, also lamented the absence of political parties at the meeting and said they would do better. The meeting was, however, attended by members of the civil society organisations, media, paramilitary organisations, religious leaders and  traditional rulers.
