From Ighomuaye Lucky, Benin A stalwart of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Etsako West Local Government Area of Edo State, Engr Saliu Ahmed, has said that the antecedents of the former national chairman of the party, Adams Oshiomhole will ensure him victory in the Edo North senatorial election on February 25. He said the former governor of the state will garner sufficient votes from the Auchi people to defeat his opponents based on the good things he has done for them while in power. Engr Ahmed who is the Sodiq of the Auchi kingdom and the Managing Director of Benin- Owena River Basin Development Authority, BORDA, said this while speaking with newsmen in Benin. According to Engr Ahmed, “the Auchi people are well known for not abandoning their benefactors, rather than doing so, they will meet such persons halfway in their hours of need. ” In a nutshell, the administration of the former comrade governor really favoured Auchi as it was during his eight-year tenure that some attention was paid to the deplorable state of the roads in Auchi, especially the gully erosion menace. “Hitherto, successive regimes had paid lip service to these twin problems until the Oshiomhole’s administration took them headlong and decimated them, to the admiration of the people who had borne the brunt of the menace for years. “Checks reveal that on the two occasions Comrade Oshiomole contested for the highest political office in the state, he got the highest number of votes, both in his first coming and reelection bid, from Auchi to make the difference”. Engr Ahmed further said the Auchi people are not ingrates and they will not abandon someone who has sacrificed a lot for the good of the community and begin to chase shadows, adding that the former comrade governor will never be forgotten in a hurry for the infrastructural facelift gave to Auchi .
