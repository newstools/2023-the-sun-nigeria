From Desmond Mgboh, Kano Former Emir of Kano, Sanusi Lamido, yesterday, made history as he stopped over in Kano to visit his mother,  three years after he was dethroned from the stool. The presence of the former emir quickly attracted well wishers who stormed some major roads to greet him, resulting in traffic congestion along the roads leading to his mother’s home on Dabo Road. Sanusi , who clarified the situation, explained that he was actually on transit to Dutse, Jigawa State, through Kano to pay condolences to the people of the state over the death of their Late Emir,  the Late Dr Nuhu Muhammadu Sanusi. According to him, they had bad flying weather which caused their flight to land at Kano International airport to ensure the safety of the passengers. He said that, “Upon landing in Kano, hundreds of people stormed the airport and persuaded me to at least come and greet my mother, which I did” He said that at the home of his mother, he met so many well wishers who prayed for him with love and affection and wished him well. The former Emir remarked that as a citizen of Nigeria, he has the right to go to any part of the country of his choice adding that there is a court judgment in his favour to that effect. The former Emir of Kano has since departed the state for his destination.
