Nigerian comedian, Samson Adeleke, popularly known as Mc Fantasy, has commended citizens for still finding a way to laugh, despite the hardship in the country. Mc Fantasy said that comedy was the only thing that would keep Nigerians together at the moment. “If not some people would have lost their minds. Comedy is the only therapy that is helping us with the current situation going on in Nigeria. “Even the politicians themselves are comedians. Our leaders are indeed acting more like comedians than doing what we voted them to do. “In the midst of the hardship, people still find a way to laugh with content and that is why apps on social media like the Instagram and Tiktok Facebook are getting more popular and entertaining,“ he said. Mc Fantasy also urged Nigerians to vote for the most credible candidate in the forthcoming elections. “With the 2023 general elections already here, Nigerians should vote for the most credible candidate, irrespective of tribe or religion. “Nigerians should vote for the candidates of their choice, by what their manifesto present rather than the gifts they tend to get,” he said. The comedian who had shared the stage with the likes of Ali Baba, the king of comedy, in Chicago, also urged Nigerian comedians to grow beyond the shores of the country by collaborating with their colleagues across the globe. “Being in America is an eye-opener for me and seeing the good efforts put in by comedians. Americans receive our jokes very well, they are very attentive to jokes, so they get jokes easily and you sometimes don’t stress yourself. Americans don’t have that much problem in their life, as long as they can relate to it, our gesticulations especially, make them laugh easily,” he noted. MC Fantasy is one of the topmost sought after wedding MCs in the U.S. He started hosting event back in Nigeria, before relocating to the U.S. in 2014, to undergo his Master’s degree programme at the Western Illinois University.
