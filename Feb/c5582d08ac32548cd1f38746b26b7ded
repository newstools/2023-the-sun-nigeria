Worried by challenges some Lagosians, especially the vulnerable and less privileged, are facing currently as a result of naira and fuel scarcity in the country, Lagos State Governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, yesterday said the state government will roll out food packs through various bodies from Monday, to reduce the level of suffering and bring succour to them. The governor, who disclosed that the half price on buses, boats, Lagride and other public transportation using Cowry cards will be extended from the initial one week to continue for a long time, said his administration is working with the health sector to see how best the state can ameliorate the hardship being faced by Lagos residents. Governor Sanwo-Olu spoke yesterday at the Lagos State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria’s (CAN), Inter-Denomination Divine Service (IDDS) 2022 held at the LAWNA Territorial Headquarters, Ketu in Lagos. The theme of the programme, which was attended by all the Christian blocs in Lagos State to pray for the state and Nigeria was “Peace. Be Still – Mark 4 vs 39.” Governor Sanwo-Olu, who was the Special Guest of Honour, attended the event in the company of his wife, Dr. Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, and members of the Lagos State Executive Council said his administration will continue to fight for the less privileged and the downtrodden to ensure that people are broken from shackles of poverty.
