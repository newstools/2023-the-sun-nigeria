From Molly Kilete, Abuja  Gunmen have invaded  Munu, a community in Abaji Area Council in the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), killing two persons and abducted scores of villagers. The incident was said to have taken place at about midnight Tuesday night, when the gunmen stormed the community in their numbers shooting sporadically. The incident which lasted for over one hour according to the villagers, resulted in the killing of two villagers and abduction of several others. The gunmen were also said to have engaged in the looting of  beer parlor and a provision shop before leaving the village with the abducted persons. It was gathered that some personnel of the mobile police force deployed to the  neighboring community of Rubochi,  housing the Federal Government College , who visited the area upon hearing the sounds of gunshots, arrived the area after the gunmen had gone but promised to come back. One of the villagers who does not want to be mentioned in print for fear of being attacked, said “Some mobile police force personnel  deployed to our neighbouring community of Rubochi, where the Federal Government College(FGC), is located visited us about 30 minutes after the attack  and promised to come back for fact finding,”. When contacted, the FCT police command public relations officer Josephine Adeh, promised to find out the true situation of the attack as soon as possible and get back but failed to do so at the time of filing this report.
