Beautiful Nollywood actress, Ijeoma Thomas has opened up on the challenges she had at the initial stage of her career. In an encounter with Saturday Sun, Ada Umuahia as she’s fondly called by her friends and associates, said she faced several challenges ranging from sexual harassments to poor welfare among others. “One of the challenges I had included not being paid for jobs done, as producers, who after working for them and having being paid by the marketers, ended up pocketing the money. Another challenge is, as far as you are nobody, they don’t care about your welfare. I was sexually harassed several times. In fact, for you to be happy and successful, you need to date the producer or the owner of the film. A lot of us who are not ready to go through that trauma were made to go through hell. This made me to become a crewmember; I had to join costume and makeup. I went to learn it so that people will stop humiliating me. There are lots of challenges but what matters most is ‘Are you ready to go through them? Are you seeing your tomorrow ahead?’ Then, you have to face it. Face your fears and you will make it in life,” she told Saturday Sun  The Hustlers star further shared lessons she learnt from her days of humble beginning. “I learnt a lot. I come from humble beginning. Every single day, I wake up to create and live the life I am most proud of. It is my choice.  Looking back to where and how I started, I am so grateful for my humble beginning. They taught me precious life lessons that no teacher or school could ever teach me. Without them, I wouldn’t be a human being. Looking back at my life and career, I don’t think I have done any wrong that I will like to make right. Nothing, absolutely nothing! I am happy with the steps I took in my life and career.”
