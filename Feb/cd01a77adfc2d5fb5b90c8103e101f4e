The Abuja division of the Federal High Court in Abuja has dismissed a suit seeking the sack of the Inspector General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba Alkali. Justice James Omotosho, who delivered the judgment on Tuesday, held that the suit by Michael Sam Idoko, who claimed to be a “social crusader,” lacked the locus standi to file the suit and cannot hide under the guise of public interest to approach the court on the issue of whether or not the IGP should retain his office. Justice Omotosho held that the plaintiff failed to establish that he has any peculiar or special interest in who occupies the office of the IGP over and above other Nigerians. He held noted that there was no evidence showing that he (the plaintiff) is a serving police officer, who is qualified for appointment or has ever applied for the IGP position and was denied. Idoko had, through his lawyer, James Onoja (SAN) filed the suit marked FHC/ CS/ 31/2023 to challenge the legality of the continuous stay of the IGP in the office having allegedly served out his tenure.
