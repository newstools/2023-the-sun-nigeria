From Abel Leonard, Lafia Following the poor performance of Nasarawa United in the ongoing Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL) 2022/2023 season, chairman of the club, Barrister Isaac Danladi could be shown the exit door as the state Ministry of Youth and Sports Development is already making plans for a replacement. Recall that the ministry headed by Isaac Lucky Yargwa had handed the team management a three-match ultimatum to savage their job. The three matches were against Gombe United, Plateau United and Shooting Stars of Ibadan which the team was able to gather only one point siting bottom at the NPFL abridged league table in group A. Also Recall that the team had played six NPFL matches, losing five and drawing against Gonbe United away from its adopted home, Kaduna. According to sources, the state government is not happy with the situation hence the need to change the management of the team and some notable names have been penciled down for the job.
