From Scholastica Onyeka, Makurdi The Governorship Candidate of the All Progressives Congress, (APC), in Benue State, Rev Fr Hyacinth Alia has promised to provide incentives and grants to farmers to boost rice production in the state when he becomes the Governor. Alia made the promise when he led the APC campaign team on a tour of Obagaji and Ogbokpo in Agatu and Apa local government areas of the state. He acknowledged that the people of Agatu and Apa are largely economically dependent on farming but lamented that insecurity has halted farming activities in many areas. The priest, however, promised to end insecurity and give priority attention to timely supply of subsidized farm inputs especially fertilizer and quality seeds to farmers to boost their farm produce. He also assured the people of his willingness to provide the basic social amenities critical to human existence and social growth such as good roads, housing, water, power and job creation. While paying homage to the traditional rulers, the gubernatorial hopeful frowned at their welfare packages which said was meagre and promised to up it once he takes over as the governor of the state. He also reiterated his earlier promise to civil servants and pensioners, saying he would ensure their entitlements are paid as at when due. The APC governorship candidate stressed the need for Benue to reconnect itself with the Federal executives to gain more federal presence in the state. He further called on the people to vote Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and all other APC candidates for a fair, transparent and accountable leadership. The APC Senatorial Candidate for Benue South, Dan Onjeh, the House of Representatives and all the assembly candidates as well as party chairmen at the two local government areas amongst other party members all drummed the support of the people to enable APC win the forthcoming elections.
