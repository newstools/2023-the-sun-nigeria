JOE EFFIONG, UYO The former spokesman for the House of Representatives, Mr Eseme Eyiboh has taken the defeat in his attempt to return to the National Assembly with philosophical calmness. Eyiboh who was the House spokesman when Demiji Bankole was the speaker of the House of Representatives, re-contested for the Eket federal constituency ticked in the last Saturday’s election on the platform of the APC,  but  was  narrowly defeated by his PDP opponent, Mr Opolupm Etteh. But reacting in a press statement made available to Daily Sun on Tuesday, titled, “History on the Run: I was Never Defeated; We Have Rather Lost,” he said he contested the February 25th election which presented the people the opportunity to determine a particular question bordering on the future of the community. “I stood up as the standard bearer of this historic pursuit in an interesting time. The vision to rebuild a new community was clear, the courage to trigger a change in our socio-economic trajectory was unambiguous.  “Today, the eclipse is on the balance and as determined as we were, we couldn’t account for the conflict in our personal interest and community affairs. The treacherous dark lines were not directed at me but the victims shall be those young people who have never felt the flavour of transformational leadership and role models.” “Somewhere in the history of our community, those who shall be fortunate to live, shall give the audit account of the various class acts and the associated individual roles embedded in this sad note.  “Our social democratic values may have been stretched but the panoramic effect of the invidious narrative shall remain a sore in our page.   As just as our history as a people remains, I was never defeated but we have rather lost.” He signed off.  ENDS
