The anniversary which commenced on Thursday, February 9, was to end on Monday 20th of February with the commissioning of the Sagbama/Ekeremor road by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo. His Eminence, Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammad Sa’ad Abubakar, was slated to commission the Glory Drive (Igbogene Airport Road) on Tuesday, February 14. No reason was given for the indefinite postponement but sources say it may be because of the sudden demise of Governor Diri’s father, Pa Abraham Michael Joseph Diri, who died Sunday evening. A statement by the Commissioner for Information, Orientation and Strategy, Mr Ayiba Duba, said the events would hold after the Presidential election. “Bayelsa State Government hereby suspends all activities commemorating the three-year anniversary of the prosperity administration. The anniversary activities will now take place after the Presidential Election. We regret any inconveniences this suspension might have caused,” he said. Meanwhile the deputy governor, Senator Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo has announced that condolence registers have been opened to enable Bayelsans to condole with the governor and his family. According to him, the registers have been opened at Government House Yenagoa, Bayelsa State House of Assembly, Judiciary Complex, and Bayelsa State liaison offices in Abuja, Lagos and Port Harcourt and Diri’s country home in Sampou, Kolokuma/Opokuma Local Government Area.
