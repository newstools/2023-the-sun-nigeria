For Olanrewaju Nwabueze aka Larry Foreman, despite the nature of his job and commitment to Christianity, religion is not a hindrance to his career.  The US-based Nigerian MC and event host asserted that Christianity doesn’t affect his line of work; rather he lets his faith reflect in his works. Aside his mantra of branding himself as a unique individual, Foreman also believes in regulating the entertainment industry to give direction amongst creatives such as MCs, hypemen and hypewomen.  He said: “There should be checks and balances, and systems that help people understand that the industry is not a joke and everything requires a level of technical know-how.”
