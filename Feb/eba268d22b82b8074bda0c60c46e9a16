Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, has accused governors of the All Progressives Congress (APC) of allegedly  preparing the ground for anarchy in the country through their utterances over the naira redesign. The former vice president, in a statement by his Special Assistant on Public Communications, Phrank Shaibu, sympathised with Nigerians over the hardship they are facing over the naira scarcity. He berated APC governors threatening to shut banks for rejecting the old N500 and N1000. “The APC and their governors do not love the masses, their only grouse is their inability to buy votes because of this policy. Nigerians must not be deceived by these unscrupulous politicians. With elections less than five days away, the ultimate goal of the sponsors of these riots may be the postponement of elections. We commend the military and the police so far for curbing some of these riots. However, we call on them to go a step further by identifying their sponsors” he said
