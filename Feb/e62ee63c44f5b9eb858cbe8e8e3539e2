More woes for Auwal Mohammed, the Camp Commandant of Shooting Stars as his employer has placed him on an indefinite suspension over his ridiculous acts during the team’s NPFL Matchday 9 fixture against visiting Akwa United of Uyo, BSNSports.com.ng has gathered. Auwal, it will be noted, was pictured urinating at the centre of the Lekan Salami Stadium pitch, a development that has earned him a one-year ban from the league body, the Interim Management Committee (IMC). Unhappy with such activity, which the club condemned in totality, the management queried Auwal to explain what led to such a behaviour in public glare. After going through his response, the management found out that Auwal, actually perpetrated the act, which the club was not a party to. The club frowned over such a despicable act, which has subjected the club to public embarrassment and has therefore, decided to sanction the official, in line with the disciplinary measures taken by the IMC. Therefore, Mr Auwal Mohammed has been asked to proceed on an indefinite suspension which will see him stay off all the club’s activities during the period of his suspension.
