Abuja residents are heaving a sigh of relief as fuel queues seem to be tinning out gradually after weeks of biting scarcity. Daily Sun gathered that the soothing development emanated from an expanded meeting of stakeholders in the downstream sector of the petroleum sector where various logistics and supply challenges were resolved. The meeting was at the instance of the Group Chief Executive Officer of the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPCL), Mr Mele Kyari and haulage companies Motorists who spoke with Daily Sun yesterdaydescribed the relief as most welcome as many had been forced to either sleep at filling stations or purchased the product at prohibitive price s of over N400/litre. James Agumba, a commercial bus driver said: “I’m happy that the queues have drastically reduced. “I used to sleep at filling stations. I even slept last Sunday but today, in less than 30 minutes, you will get the product. I only hope this tempo is sustained”, . Also savouring the joy of the moment, Mrs Aisha Mohammed, urged the authorities not to make the relief a temporary arrangement but permanent solution.
