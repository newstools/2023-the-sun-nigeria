• Says those supporting Naira swap are enemies of Nigerians From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has declared that the National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Iyorcha Ayu,  has indulged in an unpardonable anti-party activity when he campaigned against the party in Kano State saying “PDP has brought us shame.” The governor maintained that if there is any section of PDP that has brought shame, full of lies and is bad, it is the national headquarters under their leadership, not the PDP in Rivers State because that one is good. Governor Wike made the accusation at the campaign flag-off rally organised by the Rivers State Campaign Council for Eleme Local Government Area that held at the Community Secondary School Field, Alode Town, Eleme on Friday. The Rivers State governor insisted that Ayu spoke out of the abundance of his heart, even though he might want to defend it as a slip. “When you see undertakers you will know those who came to kill this party. But the party will not die, they will die first. I didn’t know they are wicked to this party, no wonder they left this party and joined ACN before.  “He (Ayu) said they will not allow PDP to be in power. Is that a good chairman? It that not anti-party? Is the chairman not doing anti-party. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. For us in Rivers State, our own party is a good party. Our own is a party that has done Rivers State well.” Governor Wike also spoke about the poor implementation of Naria redesign policy implementation and the socioeconomic hardship that it has caused Nigerians. The governor said those supporting the poorly implemented Naira redesign policy are enemies of the people and the country. Governor Wike wondered why the national leadership of the PDP that  is in opposition, and should always side with the people in the quest to return to power at the federal government level, would support the anti-people policy.
