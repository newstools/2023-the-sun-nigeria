From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri Borno State Governor Babagana Zulum has ordered the release of drugs and medicines worth over N300 million to be given free to patients at state-owned hospitals and health centres. The governor’s order for the release of the drugs was announced in a statement by his spokesman, Isa Gusau, in Maiduguri. “Borno State governor, Prof Babagana Zulum has ordered the release of over N300 million worth of drugs and other medical supplies to government hospitals for free distribution to patients most of whom were facing difficulties in making payments due to scarcity of naira notes,” he disclosed. He said the commissioner of Health has already unveiled the drugs at the state medical store in the capital on Wednesday. The supplies included drugs for prevalent illnesses, maternal delivery kits and other medical essentials, Gusau explained. He said the commissioner has equally directed medical directors and principal medical officers (PMOs) of the state public healthcare centres, especially in Maiduguri Metropolitan Council and adjoining Jere Local Government, to “quickly prepare procedural papers” to receive the mendicant and drugs. Daily Sun checks in Maiduguri show that many patients have abandoned treatment in the hospitals as they could not get cash to pay for drugs. Others who attempted to use e-payment were also frustrated due to poor banking networks as hospital officials declined to give drugs or medical items until their POS machine print out the payment vouchers.
