Chairman, PFAN task force Harrison Jalla has condemned in strong terms the decision forcing Rivers United to play its CAF Confederation Cup matches away from their home ground. He noted that it is a sad development the current NPFL champions Rivers United would play their next CAF Confederation Cup matches outside the Adokie Amiesimaka Stadium despite the two letters within one week from CAF to the Nigeria Football Federation requesting inspection of the Adokie Amiesimaka Stadium. The ground he pointed out has severally hosted CAF championship matches in the past. “Unfortunately nothing was done on the part of the NFF within the time frame given by CAF due to gross negligence. Who are the officers in charge? The NFF President Ibrahim Gusau must fish out those concerned and reprimand them accordingly. “Tthere should be no sacred cow. It is a national embarrassment for a club that has the facility to host its home games to play outside its home ground because of the incompetence and negligence of those in charge.” Jalla further noted that there are serious financial implications for clubs to play outside their home ground and a huge minus not to get the usual massive home fans support. “In this case the Adokie Amiesimaka Stadium is not new to hosting International matches. Rivers United is flying Nigeria’s Flag in CAF Confederation Cup and it’s the duty and responsibility of the NFF to support and give all necessary cooperation to Rivers United to win the CAF Cup for Nigeria. Nigeria Football is in a new order with all hands on deck to progress from the disaster it was enmeshed in from September 2014 to September 2022 lapses like this should be nipped in the bud by the NFF President Ibrahim Gusau. Somebody must be held accountable for this injustice to Rivers United,” Jalla emphasized.
