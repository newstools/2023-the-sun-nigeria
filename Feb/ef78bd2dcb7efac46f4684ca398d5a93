A humorous image of Ghanaian star Kamaldeen Sulemana standing up on the tip of his toes to Nigerian international Paul Onuachu to measure his height has surfaced on Southampton’s social media channels. Upon his transfer from Belgian club KRC Genk, the Nigerian player surpassed Newcastle United’s 201-cm-tall Dan Burn to become the tallest player to compete in the English Premier League. Following that, the 21-year-old, who joined the Saints in January with Onuachu after moving from Stade Rennais FC, was seen making a humorous attempt to measure his height with his teammate from Southampton. The caption of the image posted on Southampton’s social media page included a humorous emoji that read that the Ghanaian had a decent attempt. “Good try” the caption reads. Sasa Kalajdzic (200 cm), Asmir Begovi (199 cm), Jannik Vestergaard (199 cm), and Wout Weghorst (197 cm) are a few of the tallest players in the league this season. Onuachu, who scored a few goals for the Smurfs in the Belgian Pro League, was regarded as having an advantage in the attack owing to his physique. Before departing Cegeka Arena, the Nigerian attacker led the Belgian league in goals scored with 16 in 19 league games.
