The 23-time Grand Slam champion officially announced her retirement from tennis in September 2022, but as part of a new ad campaign she’s combining golf and acting. Williams will star in an upcoming Caddyshack-inspired Super Bowl ad for Michelob ULTRA. The sporting legend spoke to Newsweek about making the ad, and about what’s to come in the next stage of her life. Williams is co-starring in a new Super Bowl ad alongside a number of other sporting icons, and Succession star Brian Cox. The premise of the ad sees Williams and Cox battle it out around the course, with Williams coolly getting the upper-hand, with the help of the rowdy spectators. Serena Williams returns for another Michelob commercial for the Super Bowl. She spoke to Newsweek about a potential acting career. “It was definitely a fun thing to do and being on set was really fun and cool and getting to work with everyone who was in the spot,” Williams told Newsweek.
