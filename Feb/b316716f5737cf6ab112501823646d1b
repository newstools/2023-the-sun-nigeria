Addressing journalists in his office weekend, Emechebe  said modern businesses are now online and ASPMDA would not be an exception, averring that “I want to rightly place ASPMDA on the global map of digital access so that by the punching of one button, everything you need to know about our businesses from anywhere in the world will be in your hand seamlessly.” On the readiness of his government to stamp out substandard auto products in the market, he assured that he will work with the Standard Organisation of Nigeria and relevant taskforces to end instances of fakery. Explaining more on the planned February 14th celebration of 23 years of ASPMDA exit from Lagos Island to Trade Fair complex, he said, “It would be a day of re-dedication of our lives and businesses to God and we are going to ask for His Grace and more blessings to continue in service of the motoring Nigerian public.”
