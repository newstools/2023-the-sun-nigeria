From Tony Osauzo, Benin  Some Dukes (Enigie) in Benin Kingdom,  yesterday, distanced themselves from a letter requesting the Edo State Government to constitute “Traditional Council for Edo South Local Government Areas of the State”. The dukes while addressing journalists, condemned the request, describing it as evil, sacrilegious and rebellious against the Oba of Benin. The Enogie of Iguogie Community Festus Osagiede Aiyeki, who spoke on behalf of 15 other Enigie, alleged that the demand for a Traditional Council was being spearheaded by the dukes of Egbaen-Siluko, Evbuobanosa and their allies, adding that they remain loyal to the Oba of Benin, who he described as their royal father. The Enigie warned that attempt by any individual or group to distract the Oba in any guise would be resisted by them, adding “This news of the unfortunate letter to the Edo State Government, stating that Enigie from various dukedoms in Benin Kingdom (South-South) is seeking for Edo South traditional council having the signatories of other Enigie in the kingdom was done out of total deceit. “We the Enigie of various dukes in Benin Kingdom under the most revered Oba of Benin, respectfully inform the Benin Traditional Council and the public that we are not and can never be part of such evil plans.  “We hereby distance ourselves from such rebellious cum sacrilegious act of the Enogie of Egbaen-Siluko, Enogie of Evbuobanoda and his cohorts. “To this end, the enigie in Benin Kingdom want to reiterate that Enogie of Egbaen-Siluko is no longer the Chief Coordinator of the Enigie in Benin Kingdom (Edo South), because he has since been removed by the Oba of Benin, which took effect from 3rd January, 2023. “We therefore demand that Enogie of Egbaen-Siluko and his cohorts should immediately retract their intent letter and publicly apologise to Benin Traditional Council, the entire Benin Kingdom and the world at large within the next seven days, else more punitive verdicts will be directed towards them”, they said. .
