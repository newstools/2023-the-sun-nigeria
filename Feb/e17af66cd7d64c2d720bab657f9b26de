From John Adams, Minna Former Military Head of State, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, has appealed to Nigerians to sustain the peace that was the hallmark of yesterday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections in the country. He described the polls as very peaceful and orderly, and therefore commended the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for a job well done. General Abubakar spoke in Minna shortly  after casting his vote at the hilltop polling unit Minna, the state capital. His words: “I have been able to perform my civic responsibility. I am happy we have peace in the country during the election and I urge Nigerians to sustain this peace even after the elections. “From what I have seen here, it is very comfortable, the moment they see you, the BVAS captures you and they give you your ballot papers, for you to cast your vote, this is quite commendable. INEC has done a good job and I commend them. “From all that has been going on everything is going on smoothly and peacefully, we thank God for how things are going on in Nigeria and Niger State.” Meanwhile, about 500 internally displaced persons (IDP) from three local government areas of the state yesterday cast their votes at their camp under a tight security. In Munya Local Government Area of the state, IDPs from Kuchi and Zagzaga communities cast their votes at Sarkin Pawa, the headquarters of the local government. Also, IDPs from Chibani and Gwada communities communities cast their votes at the Gwada IDP camp. Some of them who spoke to our correspondent said the exercise was hitch-free and devoid of any rancour.
