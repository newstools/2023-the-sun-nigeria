By Joe Apu D’Tigers Head Coach to the last window of the FIBA Basketball World Cup African Qualifiers, Ogoh Odaudu has expressed confidence that his players will fight its way through for a place in the World Cup. Odaudu, who is also coach of Rivers Hoopers, said in Abuja that the players in camp are ready to give their best and ensure that Nigeria gets a ticket for this summer’s World Cup holding in the Philippines, Japan and Indonesia.  “A total of 20 players are in camp and we train twice a day. Every player here is rearing to go and help Nigeria make a difference in Luanda. The fire in their eyes speaks volume for a team that is ready to battle its way for a ticket,” Odaudu stated. He also revealed that the team would be trimmed to 12 by the end of the week to enable the technical crew to concentrate on plays ahead of the task ahead. Nigeria is billed to open the race for a ticket against already qualified Cote d’Ivoire on Friday, February 24 and play against Guinea and host Angola. D’Tigers are currently placed fourth place with 10 points from 7 games on the Group E table behind leaders Cote d’Ivoire with the maximum 14 points from 7 games, Angola with 12 points from 7 games and Cape Verde with 11 points from 7 games. The other two teams in the group are Uganda and Guinea with 8 points apiece. As at this same period back in 2019, Nigeria had already qualified under the guidance of Coach Alex Nwora who ringed over 60 players before heading to the FIBA Basketball World Cup that held in China
