By Lukman Olabiyi Lagos State Governor, Mr.  Babajide Sanwo-Olu, has commended the voters for the large and impressive turnout, as well as conducting themselves peacefully during the elections held yesterday. The governor gave the commendation while speaking to journalists after casting his vote at the  Eiyekole Polling Unit, Ward RA 15, in Lagos Island Local Government Area, where he expressed his franchise. Sanwo-Olu, who arrived at the polling unit with his wife, Mrs Ibijoke Sanwo-Olu, at 10.16 a.m, did his accreditation and cast his vote at 10.25 a.m., for the presidential, senatorial and House of Representatives candidates. ‘’As you can see, as you can observe, I have just cast my vote here Lagos Island. We came in here, we sat down, and after a couple of minutes we were called for accreditation, and the accreditation went very well. ‘’My wife and I were given the ballot paper to go into a cubicle, cast our votes without any form of hindrance, without any form of intimidation. ‘’So I want to confirm that it is live and well here. I think there is a fairly good turnout here. And I want to imagine driving from State House to here, it’s been very peaceful, without any incident at all. ‘’I am hoping that for the next couple of hours while it is on, it going to be reflective of what we have seen here in all of the polling units that we have in the state and the country at large,’’ he said. The Commissioner for Youth and Social Development, Mr Segun Dawodu, who also voted at the same polling unit, commended the electorate for turning out en-masse and for conducting themselves peacefully during the elections.
