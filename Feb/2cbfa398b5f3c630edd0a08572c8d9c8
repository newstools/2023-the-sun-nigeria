Spanish La Liga top team Atletico Madrid are reportedly interested in signing Super Eagles and Napoli superstar Victor Osimhen, with Liverpool and Manchester United also chasing the Nigerian, BSNSports.com.ng has sourced. According to Il Mattino, the La Liga giants have joined the growing race to sign the Serie A forward, with Osimhen one of the best strikers in Europe this season with the 24-year-old thriving in both Italy and in the UEFA Champions League for Napoli. With 20 goals in all competitions, Osimhen heads into the summer window as one of the most in-demand players in the market, yet Atletico’s interest in signing the striker will come as a surprise to many, with reports from Football Espana and Forbes quoting that the Spanish side are in serious financial problems. With Il Mattino even stating that Atletico will struggle to sign Osimhen ‘with no money to spend’, the Colchoneros could stand no chance in matching the Napoli star’s reported £107m asking price, something Liverpool and United might afford to match given their incredible financial power as Premier League giants. Indeed, Atletico’s interest could stem from the potential sale of Joao Felix, who Chelsea could sign on a permanent deal in the summer. However, even if the Portuguese international was to be sold, Diego Simeone’s side could still struggle massively to bring Osimhen to Spain. As we know, Premier League interest is high in the Nigerian, and whilst a move to La Liga could be tempting to Osimhen, signing for Atletico when he is already at Napoli would feel too many as a sideways step for his career, which could explode in England. The Premier League is the richest division in the world, and with Liverpool and United both interested in Osimhen, it feels only natural that one of these two sides, or even a rival English club, would win the race for the Napoli star despite Atletico’s reputation. With the La Liga side enduring a rough season and not guaranteed to qualify for the Champions League next season, Osimhen would be better off signing for a club where he feels he will succeed at the most, which likely means a move to the Premier League.
