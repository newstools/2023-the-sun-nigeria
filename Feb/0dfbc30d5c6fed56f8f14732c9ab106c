The annual developmental programme for the game of Basketball in Oyo State and beyond, the Hoop Dreams Nigeria Basketball Camp, which is in its 8th Season, has been put on hold. The initiator of the Camp, Barrister Damola Awosika, stated that this year’s event which started in January was suspended due to the current naira and fuel scarcity as well as its attendance hardship and security concerns associated with movement of the participants.  “I am hoping that the week after the presidential elections, the basketball camp will resume.” Awosika, who is also the Vice Chairman of Oyo State Basketball Association (OSBA), said. He stated that the safety of the kids is the reason why the Camp was put on hold.  “Once we can guarantee there are no security issues, we will go back to the courts because the health and safety of the kids must be protected and it’s paramount to us.” He added. The Basketball Camp at the Lekan Salami Stadium in Ibadan is held every Friday and Saturday. On Friday, the training programme is held from 4pm to 6pm while on Saturday, it’s from 10am to 1pm and it’s open to kids between 5 and 18 years of age, boys and girls. After the 30 weeks of training and mentorship, all the kids will be given a certificate of participation, the coaches and trainers will also be given certificates of appreciation.  Over 500 kids attended the 7th edition of the Hoop Dreams Nigeria Basketball Camp and more kids are participating in this year’s event.
