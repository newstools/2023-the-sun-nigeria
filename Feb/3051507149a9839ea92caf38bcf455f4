From Obinna Odogwu, Awka There was a little drama at the presidential election collation centre in the premises of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Awka, when the Collation Officer for Nnewi South Local Government Area, Prof. Chinwe Isibo, raised the alarm over threats to her life. Isibo had barely finished presenting her results for the LGA to the presiding officer, Prof. Nnenna Otu, before she started shouting in the hall that her life was being threatened by some persons who had trailed her to the place from Nnewi area. She said that the people had been trailing her since the previous day being Sunday. She did not, however, disclose the reason why the situation was so. However, there were reports that thugs working for some National Assembly candidates in Anambra South Senatorial District had caused some troubles in the area. Sources said that there were shootings in the area Sunday night. The collation officer, who is a lecturer at the Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, after presenting her results, told the people in the hall that her life was in danger, appealing that she should be protected. “Please, I want everybody here to know that these men behind are after my life. They have been trailing me since yesterday and followed me to this place.  “They have been threatening me and I don’t know why they are doing this. Please, my life is in danger and let everybody know this”, she cried out. She was subsequently guided out of the hall. A few minutes later, armed policemen drove her away in their van with her twin sister.
