By Henry Uche  With the Nigerian and global business climate projected to experience significant micro and macroeconomic dynamics, ranging from inflationary cost pressures, exchange rate vagaries and disrupting talent attrition, managing director of Leadway Assurance, Tunde Hassan-Odukale, has disclosed that the company will be deploying artificial intelligence (AI), data-driven and research-oriented initiatives to drive its operations in 2023 in its quest for dominance in Nigeria’s insurance industry.  Hassan Odukale who made this known in his New Year strategic welcome message to all stakeholders said “As the business environment evolves, the speed of change being driven by technology will never be slower. This obviously has profound implications for business. Therefore, we will be deploying more data-driven and research-oriented initiatives, adopting data and artificial intelligence practices for improved processes and quick decision-making to promote immersive and exceptional customer experience.  “Indeed, part of our emphasis this year is to significantly enhance our operational excellence with improvements in our technology use. In this new year and future years, we are committed to strengthening our risk management strategies and technical expertise to ensure such risks are properly identified, assessed, and proactively mitigated,”  Hassan-Odukale affirmed that he was  confident that the future holds immense opportunities for all Leadway businesses, given government’s huge investment in public infrastructure and imminent changes in the economy.  “Leadway as an organisation will continue to tap into these emerging opportunities and pursue its strategic goal of being ‘the most dominant insurance company in Nigeria’, in revenue and profit market share, within the corporate and retail market segments,” he added.  He reiterated that the organisation cannot achieve these towering objectives without a firm commitment to provide a world-class customer experience consistently. He therefore charged his team to be more customer-centric in improving Leadway’s customers’ experience positively at every touch point in its customer service value chain
