Peoples Democratic Party (PDP)  has charged President Buhari to compel APC leaders to release new Naira notes they have allegedly hoarded. In a statement by its National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, it said that would help to assauge the hardship Nigerians are facing as a result of scarcity of the new Naira notes. The party alleged that it had earlier raised the alarm that scarcity of the Naira was orchestrated by the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign to cause crisis in the country. “It is instructive to note that Mr. President in his address to the nation earlier today, acknowledged that the Naira redesign and swap policies are programmes of the APC administration which is also completely in control of the production and circulation of the new notes. It is therefore clear that the PDP has no part in the entire process.  “Our party had earlier alerted on how APC leaders allegedly sabotaged the system and diverted the new Naira notes so as to create widespread social unrest to justify their plan to derail the 2023 general elections and truncate our democracy. “The PDP had also exposed how APC governors are allegedly warehousing the new Naira notes in facilities in Lagos, Kano, Kogi, Kaduna, Imo and other States of the country for the purpose of vote buying in the Presidential election,” the PDP stated.
