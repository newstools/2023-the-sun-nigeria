Reacting to the performance of the market, analysts at Afrinvest Research said, “Given the improvement in investor sentiment, we expect mild gains on Customs street this week”. For their part, analysts at Cordros Research, noted that investors will be caught between two opposing forces ranging from uncertainties ahead of the nation’s presidential election, and the release of 2022 corporate earnings with accompanying dividend declarations. “Consequently, we expect more of a choppy theme as cautious trading takes center stage ahead of the 2023 general elections scheduled to hold later in the week. Notwithstanding, we advise investors to take positions in only fundamentally justified stocks as the weak macro story remains a significant headwind for corporate earnings”, they said.
