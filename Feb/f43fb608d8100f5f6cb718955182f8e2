From Oluseye Ojo, Ibadan Ahead of the National Assembly poll on February 25, this year, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Oyo South Senatorial District, Chief Joseph Olasunkanmi Tegbe, has commenced grading of some roads in Ido Local Government Area of Oyo State. Daily Sun was reliably informed that grading of some roads across the 10 wards in the local government has been divided into two phases. Five wards, which are four, five, six, seven and 10, have been listed as the beneficiaries of the phase one of the project, while the second phase that is expected to cover the remaining five wards would begin next weekend. A member of the committee set up for the project, who is also a PDP stalwart in Ido council area, Mr. Adeyanju Mustapha, confirmed the development in a statement issued by Tegbe’s Media Team on Sunday in Ibadan. He stated  that the road grading project was a demonstration of Tegbe’s unwavering commitment to the development of his senatorial district. His words: “Chief Tegbe is a man of his words. He met with the leaders of our party some weeks ago and assured them of readiness to grade the dilapidated roads. “As we speak, four graders are working in various places in Ido local government. We have covered Awosonso, Siba, Olosun, Agaloke and Idi-Ahun in ward 10; Oloro Olomo-Ariyibi Fanawole areas in ward four, Bakatari- Araromi Idowu and we are now on Abokede to Odetola, which is part of ward six.” He, however, conveyed the appreciation of all the PDP leaders in the local government area to Tegbe,  promising the full votes of the people of the council area to the senatorial candidate and all the PDP candidates during the forthcoming general elections.
