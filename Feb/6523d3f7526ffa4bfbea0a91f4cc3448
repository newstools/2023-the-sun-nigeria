From Fred Ezeh, Abuja Few days to the end of extended deadline for registration for 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME), Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), announced on Monday, that 1.6 million candidates have successfully registered for the examination. JAMB Registrar, Prof. Ishaq Oloyede, disclosed the development in Abuja, shortly after he monitored the registration exercise alongside the Permanent Secretary, Federal Ministry of Education, Andrew David Adajoh, at some Computer Based Test (CBT) centres in Abuja. He said the board has apprehended about 15 persons who operated against conduct of the UTME registration processes. He said: “We have the challenge of the normal people who want to defraud the process as we have been monitoring what has been happening. We are ahead of them even when they think they are clever.” Meanwhile, the Permanent Secretary, in his remarks, said there was need to extend the registration to give others faced with the challenge of naira redesigning the opportunity to register. “This is because registration process is dependent on bank operations and we have not have the top level of bank operations in the last two to three weeks for understandable reasons,” he said.” He noted that before the extension of registration by one week, JAMB had actually registered about 98 per cent candidates, saying that no one would be left behind in its registration process. He also disclosed that registration for Direct Entry candidates commenced on Monday, 20th February, 2023.
