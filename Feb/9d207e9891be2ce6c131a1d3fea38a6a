The National Salaries, Incomes and Wages Commission (NSWIC) says it is poised to building the capacity of its staff to tackle emerging wages challenges. The Chairman of the commission, Mr Ekpo Nta, said this while signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the commission and National Centre for Technology Management (NACETEM) on Wednesday in Abuja. He said the signing of the document would go a long way in ensuring specialised training modules for the commission in data gathering, research methodology and analytical tools. According to him, one of the ways for the commission to be abreast of emerging trends with regards to its mandate is to to reinvent itself. “The collaboration that  culminated in the signing of this MoU started in 2020 when we received a proposal from NACETEM  requesting for participants for the trainings they organise. “Thereafter we met with NACETEM zonal team to work out specialised training module for the commission. “The meeting led to a capacity building exercise for 55 staff in the operation and other support departments in NSIWC. “We followed this up with further trainings for staff of the commission in Akure in 2021 and in Abuja in 2022,” he said. The wages commission boss said the MoU that was signed would help exchange ideas, concepts and training manuals. He further said it would help with sharing of data for research purposes, among other things. Nta said it was necessary for government agencies to collaborate to better deliver on their mandates.
