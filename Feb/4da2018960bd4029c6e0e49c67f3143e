…School awaits autopsy report By Gabriel Dike The management of Chrisland Schools, Lagos yesterday explained how Whitney Adeniran, a 12-year-old a pupil of the school slumped and died under a circumstance that is now under investigation.The school in an unsigned statement dated Sunday, February 12, 2023, said, “it is instructive to state, that Whitney slumped in public view and not under any hidden circumstances, whatsoever.“Our immediate response was to take advantage of proximity to first-aid, by identifying the nearest medical facility to take her to, where the doctor on duty, administered oxygen and every aid possible on her.’’The management and staff of schools expressed deep sense of loss and announced the death of Whitney Adeniran.“We are heartbroken and distressed. Whitney was one of our day students, who opted not to participate in the inter-house sports match-past for reasons we were not very sure of.“However, on discretion, we respected her decision to err on the side of caution, because on the 20th of January 2023, it is in our records that she had complained about a not-too-buoyant health and we immediately contacted her parents. Her father, Mr. Michael Adeniran, came to the school to take her home. We emphasized to her parents to take a critical look at her,’’ the statement added.The school said as her family make funeral plans for her immediate burial, the management differed politely and reiterated the need to establish a scientific verification of the underlying cause of her death, as mandatorily required in circumstances like this.It stressed that: “We immediately notified regulatory stakeholders and agencies to allow for a comprehensive evaluation and assessment of the developments.“In spite of the compelling imperatives to fill any information gaps in public space, we stopped short of making any media sensation out of this, because the deceased in question was a minor and is deserving of our unqualified respect.“As parents, we feel the deep pain of this loss and our thoughts and prayers, are continually with the family and friends of our beloved Whitney.“As we continue to uphold the sobriety of this moment, we resist any urge to join issues on her treasured memory, in media trends.”The school management said as it awaits the outcome of an independent post mortem process, it would remain unwaveringly committed to supporting the family at this critical moment.
