UK Sport has said that banned British sprinter, Chijindu Ujah will not be granted public funding until he has paid them £10,665 ($12,906/€12,115). Ujah was hit with a 22-month ban from the Athletics Integrity Unit after being found guilty of testing positive for two banned substances at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. The 28-year-old helped Britain win silver in the men’s 4×100 metres relay in the Japanese capital only for the team to be stripped of the medal following his doping violation. His ban is due to expire in June this year. UK Sport has released a statement saying Ujah will be unable to receive funding during his ban and will remain ineligible until he has paid his outstanding dues. “The panel found that Chijindu Ujah was in automatic breach of the eligibility policy owing to his previous admission of an anti-doping violation,” UK Sport said. “In line with the available powers, the panel determined that Chijindu Ujah would be ineligible to receive public funding or publicly funded benefits with effect from 6 August 2021 to 6 June 2023. “In addition, the panel noted that a previous eligibility panel met on 31 October 2019 and determined that Chijindu Ujah owed outstanding funds to UK Sport. “The sum of £10,665 remains outstanding and until that sum is paid in full, he will remain ineligible to receive public funding.” Ostarine and S-23 – both substances banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency – were found in Ujah’s samples collected at the Games. Ujah, who ran the first leg in the Olympic final, claimed that the substances had not been knowingly taken, blaming a contaminated supplement. While he appealed at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Ujah was found guilty of violating anti-doping rules. UK Athletics technical director Stephen Maguire said last October that Ujah would be considered for selection once he has returned from his drugs ban providing he is producing fast times.
