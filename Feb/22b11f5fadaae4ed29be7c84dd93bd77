From John Adams, Minna The governorship candidate of the People Democratic Party (PDP) in Niger State, Alhaji Isah Liman Kantigi has denied his alleged death threat of Electorates in the state ahead of the March 11 governorship election in the state, describing such publications as fictitious and amount to character assassination. Recalled that some National Dailies and Online Publications (not the sun), had reported that the governorship candidate in a viral video allegedly issued death threat to his supporters, saying that anyone who takes his money without supporting his ambition during the March 11 governorship poll in the state will face humiliation and later die. But in a statement in Minna by the Director Communications, Niger PDP Campaign Council, Content Officer (North) and Media Analyst, PDP Presidential Campaign Council, Alhaji Yahaya Mohammed (Sai Baba) said the publications are not only false but a calculated attempts to tarnish the good image and the growing popularity of the governorship candidate ahead of the poll. The statement reads in parts; “The Attention of the People’s Democratic Party campaign Council in Niger State has been drawn to a fictitious story by major National dailies on a fictional, fictitious and spurious video claiming that PDP gubernatorial candidate, Hon. Isah Liman Kantigi was caught on Camera threatening his supporters with death if they collected Monies and refused to vote for him” According to Yahaya Mohammed in the statement, the publications were the hand work of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the state that its candidates at all levels have come under verbal and physical attacks in their campaigns from the electorates who are tired of many failed promises and hardship unleashed on them by the ruling party. While putting the records straight, the statement said, “The fact is that, the gubernatorial candidate in the said video was speaking about the manner in which contractors collected monies in billions from APC Government and out rightly refused to carry out projects for the masses to benefit without any sanction”, adding that the governorship candidate in the said video told the people that such corrupt practices will not be tolerated in his administration if voted into office. The Director of Communications argued that the full and unedited video explained in details, the submission by the governorship candidate, stressing that “the opposition carefully and dubiously edited the video just to give a different impression to the general public”. He pointed further that “ordinarily, the campaign council wouldn’t have bothered itself with such a mischief publications designed to give a lifeline to the suffocating and gasping APC and its candidates in the state, who now fear even their shadows, but since, our friends in media who should know better, were misled to take it without knowing the context and scene at which such doctored video was created or seeking a balance of their reports, it becomes imperative to put out the fact out for all”, he added. The statement submitted that “For the avoidance of doubts, Kantigi’s philosophy and generosity for over 30 years now, has being unconditional and with no strings attached”, saying that the outcome of the March 11 governorship election in the state will not change that philosophy. For clarity and record, the next PDP Government of Niger State will be purposeful, people driven, Projects and Development focused. Any contractor coming to continue the APC ways of taking monies with no work done will face the consequences.
