The Executive Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, has charged management staff of the Commission to see themselves as critical stakeholders in the anti-corruption crusade, while exploring new initiatives to further galvanise the fight against economic and financial crimes in Nigeria.  He gave the charge at a three-day management retreat of the Commission, which began on Monday, at the Radisson Blu Anchorage Hotel, Victoria Island, Lagos, with the theme: “Consolidating on Achievements for Enhanced Performance and Greater Impact”.  He said: “We are the leaders of this organisation, and we cannot expect angels to come down and help us.”  Bawa said the retreat was convened to create a family atmosphere, where “we are expected to tell ourselves the truth – the whole truth.  “Luckily, at the EFCC, we have our own strategic plan, so we need to go through and come up with ways we want to move the commission to greater heights.”  He further urged the participants to think outside the box, stressing that, “we are not only doing it for ourselves, but for the EFCC and our country, Nigeria.”  While making a reference to the achievements of Lewis Hamilton, the seven-time Formula One driver, he stressed that cooperation was needed for success and progress to be achieved “as Hamilton could not have achieved the feat without those working with him. We need to re-strategise and build the system,” he said.
