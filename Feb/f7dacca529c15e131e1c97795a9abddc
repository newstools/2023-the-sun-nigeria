From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Igbo youth group, Coalition of South East Youth Leaders (COSEYL), has thrown its weight behind the planned peace summit by the elders council of Ohanaeze Ndigbo. The group called for the release of the leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu, detained by the Department of State Services (DSS) for alleged treason, as a condition to attend the summit. President General of the group, Goodluck Ibem, in a statement in Owerri, yesterday, commended the Chairman, Ohanaeze Elders Council, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, for coming up with the idea of the peace summit in the South East.   “The move for a peace summit is pertinent at this point in time because insecurity has taken over our land and something has to be done to bring to a halt this evil called insecurity which has taken over the South East. Ndigbo is known for peace, togetherness and industrialisation and that trait is gradually eluding us as a people,” Ibem said.  He said peace remained the only panacea to good governance and that holding successful elections would be challenging when most parts of the country were under threats.  He urged all South East governors to give the summit the necessary support to succeed. He also commended the tireless efforts of Ohanaeze Ndigbo to secure the release of Nnamdi Kanu from DSS custody.  He said: “South East governors should try and leave electioneering and press on President Muhammadu Buhari to release Mazi Nnamdi Kanu unconditionally as ordered by the Federal Court of Appeal.   The nation is at a loss if the South East that is a major commercial hub of the country is in utter disarray. The South East governors should give Ohanaeze all the necessary backing needed to make this move a huge success. If there is no peace, it will be difficult to hold successful elections, hence, the need for peace before the elections.”
