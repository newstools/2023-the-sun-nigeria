To encourage its members cultivate a healthy lifestyle, the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN) in collaboration with Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers Limited, Universal Insurance, Medicard Health Management, Ruza Herbal and Agewell last Saturday organised a health walk.   According to the AGN, the 10 kilometers health walk commenced from Surulere Local Government and ended at Teslim Balogun Stadium, Surulere, Lagos, where a fitness coach took the actors on several exercises. They also had various tests to ascertain their medical and health statuses. The walk, which took place simultaneously in Port Harcourt, Rivers State, will hold in Enugu on March 3, Asaba on March 4 and other states on a latter date. In his welcome address, AGN’s president, Emeka Rollas, said the body has recorded yet another milestone in its corporate existence. “Never in the past has the AGN worked so passionately for the overall wellbeing, dignity and betterment of her members. I call on all Nollywood practitioners both home and abroad to embrace this initiative.  We do not only do them for ourselves, but also for the wellbeing of all actors whose voices are yet to be heard, and for actors yet unborn. That they may meet an AGN that looks after their interest at all times. This will be another legacy of our administration, the AGN Health and Wellness programme from today will be an annual event.”  Speaking, Obinna Asonye, Micro Pension Manager with Stanbic IBTC Pension Managers Limited, disclosed that pension is about ensuring eradication of old age poverty, because everyone needs a plan that will take care of their old age when they can no longer work actively. Nollywood artistes that attended the programme included Desmond Elliot, Alex Okoroji, Deyemi Okanlawon, Sunny Mcdon, Steve Eboh, Ijeoma Imoh, Elder O, MC Senator, John Agoha, Emeka Rising, Grace Amah, Ifeoma Okeke, Charles Inojie, and Emeka Duru among others.
