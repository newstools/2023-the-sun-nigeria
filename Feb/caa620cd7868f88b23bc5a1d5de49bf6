By Chinelo Obogo  The Rector of the Kwara State -owned International Aviation College (IAC), Ilorin, Captain Okatahi Yakubu, has solicitated for more Federal Government support for the institution through grants or subventions to fully achieve its mandate of teaching and research. Yakubu who said this during an interview in his office in Ilorin, Kwara State, with aviation correspondents, who were in the college for a one-week training, said the school is open to investors who are willing to partner with it through the Public Private Partnership arrangement. According to him, the Kwara State government has lived up to its expectations in funding the school but subventions and support from the Federal Government would go a long way in putting the institution in an international pedestal. He noted that currently, facilities within the college need upgrade, with at least, three unserviceable trainer aircraft that would cost about N4.5 million to fix. “The state government is trying its best, it is proactive and is keen on developing the school, salaries are paid as and when due, the state government released money for aircraft and parts purchase, fuel and upgrade of the college but it will be very good for federal government to help us , the waiver on spare parts should be extended to us, they should give us subvention yearly because we are training Nigerians,” he said. Yakubu who disclosed that the college would introduce engineering and cabin crew courses in the new session to shore up its revenue, revealed plans to increase the school fees from N12.5 million to over N17 million for a full course. “We need partners and investors, we need more funding, we source our forex from the third tier market, it’s been very expensive, all expenses here is based on dollar, therefore, it is reasonable for is to increase the fees. Each student pays N12.5 million for a full course but we could go higher than N17.5 million, if colleges like the Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT) that get government subvention from various sources can increase fees to over N17 million, ours may be higher because we don’t get any assistance from the Federal government. In South Africa, it is about N28 million, excluding feeding and accommodation and in the United States, it is about $40,000,” he said.
