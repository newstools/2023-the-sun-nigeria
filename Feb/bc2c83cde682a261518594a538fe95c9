Borussia Dortmund forward Karim Adeyemi has made a sensational claim after scoring a brilliant solo goal to help the Bundesliga campaigners beat Chelsea in the first leg of their UEFA Champions League knockout round tie. The closely fought match was without a goal for more than an hour inside the Signal Iduna Park until Adeyemi took matters into his own hands. The former FC Salzburg star, sensing a unique opportunity on the break, ran the length of the field, rounding both Enzo Fernandez and goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga to score the winner for Dortmund. Speaking after the game, Karim Adeyemi told a journalist who cared to ask that the reason he is so fast and strong is that he eats a lot of African food. The youngster also confessed that he got good genes from his Nigerian father. When pressed further by the journalist which of the African delicacy he consumed, Adeyemi revealed he enjoys ‘fufu’, a swallow food peculiar to Eastern and Southern Nigeria. Fufu is made by pounding cassava and can be eaten with the fingers, with a small ball dipped into an accompanying soup or sauce. Karim Adeyemi was born to a Nigerian father who hailed from the ancient city of Ibadan in present-day Oyo State. But the exciting attacker decided to play international football for Germany, his country of birth. He was in the German squad that exited the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar at the group stage. Adeyemi and his father spent the rest of December in Ibadan, Nigeria, creating more awareness for the player’s social intervention project.
