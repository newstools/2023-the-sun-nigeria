From Molly Kilete, Abuja  The police force headquarters in Abuja has warned against the circulation of what it described as fake election results by some persons on the social media and other news platforms. It said the act which is contrary to the policy and guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), is an attempt to heat up the polity and possibly create post-elections chaos.  Force Public Relations Officer, Olumiyiwa Adejobi, who gave the warning, said: “The police have observed the spreading or circulation of alleged/fake elections results on social media and other news platforms, which is contrary to the policy and guidelines of INEC.  “The police have perceived this trend as a calculated attempt to heat up the polity and possibly create post-elections chaos. We regard this as a disservice, unpatriotic, and a disinformation. The police hereby warn those who are spreading these alleged/fake election results to desist from such mischievous acts and wait patiently for INEC’s official results, which are authentic and tenable.  “The police urge Nigerians to remain calm, and go about their lawful engagements, while those who are billed to go to the polls today are requested to be orderly and law-abiding as we have re-enforced our security strategies for the smooth conclusion of the 2023 general elections.”
