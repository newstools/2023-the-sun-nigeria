The Hale End Academy graduate got on the score sheet as Stade de Reims secured a convincing 4-0 win over Troyes on matchday 23 in the division on Sunday afternoon.  Reims led 2-0 at the break thanks to goals from Marshall Munetsi and Myziane Maolida in the 10th and 44th minutes. Balogun got in on the act himself by extending the lead to 3-0 four minutes into the second half for his fifteenth goal of the season in the league.  The Arsenal loanee outpaced his marker Palmer-Brown and hit the back of the net with a left-footed strike from close range, before Jens Cadjus put the icing on the cake with eight minutes remaining.  In the race for the Golden Boot award, Balogun is the leader with one goal more than Jonathan David (Lille) and Wissam Ben Yedder (Monaco), and two more than Kylian Mbappe (PSG) and Alexandre Lacazette (Lyon).  Will Still’s side is undefeated in the last fifteen games in the Ligue 1.
