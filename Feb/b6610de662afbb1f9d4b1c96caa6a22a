Thousands of traders yesterday at the Alaba International Market roared their support for Mr Peter Obi, and the vice presidential aspirant of the Labour Party Yusufu Datti ahead of their scheduled presidential rally at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS), Lagos yesterday.   Massive crowds of supporters also joined the duo in their last state campaign rally at Tafawa Balewa Square (TBS) which also held yesterday.  The enthusiastic applause and celebrations from everyone present was a clear indication of the amount of support Obi continues to receive after dominating their opponents in a recent pre-election poll conducted by Bloomberg and emerging as the “most desired candidate” for the nation’s upcoming elections, leading them with an astounding 66% support base.  The traders, who could be heard yelling, “Our father is here,” and “Obi” at the top of their voices, were more than happy to welcome the long-awaited change in support of the Peter Obi movement as they proudly led the rally procession.  Since openly declaring his intention to run for president in the nation’s forthcoming elections, scheduled to take place on Saturday, February 25, 2023, Peter Obi’s popularity has greatly increased. The former governor of Anambra State has a huge following both online and offline, warming his way into the hearts of the nation’s future leaders – the youths.  Obi is widely seen by his supporters, the “Obidients,” as the glimmer of hope for a better future in this current state of chaos and confusion.  Despite vicious attacks from opposition candidates, Obi has continued to garner strong endorsements from influential persons from the North, the East, Middle Belt, and South-South geopolitical zones, as well as well-known Nigerian entertainers and the Izon nation, making him a formidable force.
