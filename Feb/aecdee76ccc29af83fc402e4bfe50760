Slavia Prague head coach, Jindřich Trpišovský is concerned about how the club would find a quality replacement for Peter Olayinka when the Super Eagles winger leaves the club this summer. Olayinka has been with SK Slavia Prague since 2018 when he joined from Belgian side, KAA Gent for €3.20 million. The 27-year-old has gone on to represent the Slavists 174 times, scoring 46 goals and providing 25 assists, while winning three league titles and two cups. But Olayinka’s time in the Czech Republic is about to come to an end as his contract with Slavia expires in June. The forward already has an agreement in place to join Serbian giant, Partizan Belgrade on a free transfer on the first of July. There has been pressure on Slavia Prague’s coach, Jindřich Trpišovský to drop the Nigerian star to the bench after he committed his future to another club. But the veteran gaffer ignored those calls and has continued to include Olayinka in his starting lineup. And the former Zulte Waregem forward repaid the coach’s trust at the weekend when he scored both goals to power Slavia to a 2-0 win over Slovacko on Sunday. Coach Trpišovský maintains he is happy to keep playing Olayinka and that his worry is how to find a capable replacement when the versatile winger departs.
