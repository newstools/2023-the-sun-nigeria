By Emma Jemegah More than $130 million have been earmarked as prize monies for the maiden edition of the Abuja International Marathon (AIM) slated for April 29. Suzanna Ogunniloyo, the Managing Director of Unicentral Resources Generation, organiser of the first ever road race in the Federal Capital City, stated this yesterday, in Lagos, at the unveiling of 7up as the official refreshing  partner. Ogunniloyo said the winner of the Elite race would win $55,000 with the first runners up getting $40,000 while the third place will smile home with a cash price of $30,000. She added that cash prices have also been earmarked for the fourth to the 10th place finishers. For the local runners, the Managing Director said the Nigeria winners would get N3 million, N2 million and N1 million for the first, second and third place with cash prices for those who finished from 4th to 10th positions. Mrs Ogunniloyo disclosed that the Abuja International Marathon was conceived three years ago to showcase the cultural heritage of the FCT as well as unearth the tourism potential of Nigeria. She added that apart from plan to establish an Elite Camp for long distance athletes in Abuja, her organisation has other incentives lined up to encourage local athletes to imbibe the culture of running. Meanwhile, about 3500 athletes expected to compete at the race with 120 elite athletes already signed up for the race, according to Kayode Thomas, a member of the organising committee. The Marketing consultant to the race, John Shittu, said he’s looking forward to an exciting race in Abuja, stressing that more corporate bodies are showing interest to partner Unicentral Resources.  “Very soon, we are going to unveil the main sponsor because more corporate bodies are showing interest in partnering with the Abuja International Marathon,” he said.
