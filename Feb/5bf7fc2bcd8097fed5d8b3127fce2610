By Christopher Oji  The Lagos State Police Command has identified the man in a viral video wielding a pump action gun and threatening Public peace to be Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakare. Bakare is the first President of the Supreme Body of Ogboni Association Worldwide (Oba Ogboni Agbalaiye). The command, after identifying him, declared him wanted and warned other political thugs to leave the state or risked the wrath of the police. In a statement, yesterday, the Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), SP Benjamin Hundeyin, explained that,” following the emergence of a video earlier this week, showing a man wielding a pump action rifle and threatening public peace, the CSP Egbeyemi-led Rapid Response Squad (RRS), working on actionable intelligence, carried out a sting operation on the residence of the man in the Surulere area of the state.  “Found in the suspect’s residence were three pump action rifles, one Beretta pistol magazine, one expended 9mm ammunition, one expended and three live cartridges, and a picture frame of the suspect. The suspect, Tajudeen Olanrewaju Bakare, narrowly escaped arrest and is, hereby, declared wanted. Any useful information leading to his arrest would be highly appreciated and treated with utmost confidentiality.  “While appreciating Lagosians for their vigilance and prompt information to security agencies, the Lagos State Police Command, once again, warns all troublemakers to steer clear of the state as anyone found wanting would be dealt with in accordance with the law.”
