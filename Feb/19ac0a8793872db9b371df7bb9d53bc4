Says order against FG subsists From Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Supreme Court has given an indication that its order restraining the Federal Government from ending the use of the old naira notes beyond February 10 still subsists. Although the court did not make a definite pronouncement extending or vacating the order, it held that its earlier order made on February 8, was to last till the hearing of the motion filed by the plaintiffs, which is yet to be heard. Meanwhile, the apex court has joined nine states as parties in the suit filed by Kaduna, Kogi and Zamfara challenging the propriety of the monetisation policy of the Federal Government. The states are Bayelsa, Cross Rivers, Edo, Ekiti, Lagos, Ogun, Ondo, Katsina and Sokoto states respectively. While Bayelsa and Edo States were joined in the suit as co-defendants, Ekiti, Cross Rivers, Lagos, Ogun, Katsina and Sokoto were joined as co-plaintiffs. Meanwhile, the court has ordered the original plaintiffs and the respondent – the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) – to amend the processes already filed to reflect the new parties.
