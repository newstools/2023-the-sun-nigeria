The Lagos State Blood Transfusion Service (LSBTS) says there is no risk of blood collected during voluntary donations to waste because there isn’t enough to meet requirements for individuals who need it. Mrs Olayinka Animashaun, Head, Donor Recruitment Unit, LSBTS, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on the sidelines of a blood drive that the blood banks didn’t have enough. NAN reports that the event was organised by Nigerian Red Cross Society (NRCS), Lagos Branch Youth Wing and NYSC CDS in collaboration with Aspira Nigeria Ltd and LSBTS on Saturday. The event was tagged, “Valentine Fiesta and Voluntary Blood Donation Drive’ with the theme: ‘Give Blood, Save Lives.’ Animashaun said: “When people donate blood, we have the red cells, the platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). “The life span of the red cells is 35 days. The platelets is within five to seven days and the FFP can stay for one year.” She, however, said there was no issue of blood from voluntary blood donations to waste because what is generated was not enough. “We have a lot of people in the hospitals waiting for the blood being donated here. “LSBTS distributes blood to all the 26 hospitals and sometimes, some private hospitals access blood if they register and have emergency cases. “Everything we collect here cannot last 72 hours. The blood won’t expire because we don’t even have enough,” she told NAN. Animashaun appealed to Lagos residents to voluntarily donate blood to help save lives. Earlier, Mr Olakunle Lasisi, Secretary, NRCS, Lagos told NAN that the state branch planned to raise 2,000 pints of blood in 2023. “The objective is to make sure there is enough blood in the blood banks,” he said. He called on non-governmental and corporate organisations to partner with the Red Cross’ voluntary blood donation to help save lives. (NAN)
