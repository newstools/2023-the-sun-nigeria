From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja Barrister Julius Abure, the National Chairman of the Labour Party (LP), has expressed concern over the impunity allegedly currently prevalent throughout the entire state of Lagos, where the results of the presidential elections that have been tallied in various polling places within the state are not being uploaded to the Central Server. According to Julius Abure, the officials of the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) in connivance with the security agencies were claiming that the BVAS had suddenly developed a fault, and therefore, could not function. The chairman said that information from the party’s field men had it that in places like Agege, Kosofe, Oshodi-Isolo, Surulere, and Ibeju Lekki, amongst others where results showed that Labour Party won convincingly, the INEC officials claimed that the BVAS suddenly developed a fault when it came to uploading results of the presidential election. According to him, “Information reaching me has it that in Lagos, they have refused to upload the results for the presidential election; they have uploaded that of the Senate and House of Representatives but for the presidential, they have refused. And they are using the police to drive our agents and supporters out of the place. And they said that they have firm instruction from INEC headquarters not to upload. “For example, in Kosofe, they put the collation centre in a local government area headquarters. The place is surrounded by APC and people are afraid of their lives. They are not uploading; they said that they had been given instruction to insist that the BVAS was faulty. And most of the places we won, but they have refused to upload. “As I speak, APC officials are in Yaba office of INEC negotiating with the officials. What I have said now is happening in Agege, Kosofe, Oshodi-Isolo, Surulere; we have this situation all over. In Ibeju Lekki, our local government chairman who attempted to stop them was arrested by the police.” Abure alleged that a similar situation was playing out across the collation centres in Delta State. He, however, called on INEC to ensure that only genuine and verifiable results generated from the various polling units should be uploaded. He also called on the police to help democracy to work and resist the lure by the politicians to mar the gains of democracy by refusing to be used to deny Nigerians their choice of leaders.
