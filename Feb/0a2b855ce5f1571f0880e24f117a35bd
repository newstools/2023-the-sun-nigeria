My career secret is that only God can make things happen in one’s life. I have been blessed by the almighty Allah to start my music very early.  “I lost my mum in 1982 and my love for music was known to all then. I have been able to forge ahead doing fuji music and mentoring younger musicians because of my forthrightness, as I don’t take nonsense and I’m bold to speak out. I don’t smoke weed and I am well trained. I have enjoyed the patronage of many socialites, and I thank God that I have made a success of my career and I have travelled around the world.”
