From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Atiku/Okowa Campaign Organisation has accused the All Progressives Congress (APC) and the Tinubu/Shettima Campaign Organisation of an alleged plot to scuttle the 2023 polls. The campaign, in a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, alleged that the APC was turning the country into a war zone, after it has realised that its candidate, Bola Tinubu, “cannot win in the February 25, 2023 presidential election.” The campaign noted that the APC and its leaders are allegedly the real enemies of the country, “who parade as the comforters; the same hands that play the war drums but pose as peacemakers; the very harbingers of evil who parade as the messiahs, but busy laying traps for our democracy.” It further stated that leaders of the ruling party have in last few weeks allegedly, “deliberately orchestrated a biting cash crunch in the country so as to make Nigerians to suffer, issuing treasonable statements with the notion of pushing the citizens to insurrection, while their campaign exploits the situation to unleash thugs to attack innocent Nigerians, destroy corporate and personal property just to overheat the polity and truncate the elections.” The PDP campaign added, “the questions begging for answers, which these anti-democratic elements are evading are: What was their response when ASUU went on strike for eight months? Where were they as insecurity continues to ravages our dear nation? Why did these APC governors shy away from the problems of unemployment, poverty and socio-economic development in this country? What were their responses to the issue of corruption in which they have played leading roles? “How did they respond to the closure of our universities for almost a session?”
