From Okey Sampson, Umuahia There was massive turnout of voters in Abia State in yesterday’s Presidential and National Assembly elections, as people defied the downpour in some parts of Aba, the commercial hub of the state to cast their votes. Voters began to arrive at the various polling units in the state as early as 7.30am, but unfortunately, voting materials did not come on time. From Umuahia to Aba, then to Ohafia, it was the same story of late arrival of materials as in some places, they arrived by 10am, while in some other places, they arrived by 1pm. Speaking on the development, Governor Okezie Ikpeazu said he would not give INEC pass mark over yesterday’s poll in the state because of late arrival of materials in polling units. Ikpeazu expressed the displeasure after casting his vote at Umuebere ward 7 unit 032, Umuobiakwa, in Obingwa Local Government Area of Abia state. While acknowledging that his accreditation was seamless, the governor urged that people should not be disenfranchised because of late arrival of election materials. He also advised that members of the Seventh Day Adventist Church who worship on Saturdays, should also not be disenfranchised. Ikpeazu, who is the PDP senatorial candidate for Abia South, encouraged the electoral umpire to always provide materials on time and at all the polling units. Senator Enyinnaya Abaribe after casting his vote at his Umuekweghsu Ward in Obingwa LGA, expressed optimism of winning the poll. Midway into the election, there was downpour in parts of Aba, however, people were said to have defied and queued under the rain to cast their votes. Apart from police arrest of four hoodlums, who reportedly claimed they were imported from a neighbouring state and distributed to various places within the state to suppress votes and disrupt the election, the election was generally peaceful in the state.
