Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has won the Serie A player of the month for January. Osimhen was phenomenal for Napoli in January. Fresh off the World Cup break, the Super Wagles star consistently delivered stunning performances for the Partenopeans to help them preserve and extend their lead at the summit of the Serie A table. After losing 1-0 to Inter Milan on their return to action Osimhen bounced back with a goal against Sampdoria. The 24-year-old then scored twice and got an assist in Napoli’s 5-1 demolition of Juventus. The Super Eagles did not relent as he followed up with a clinical finish against Salernitana in their 2-0 victory. Osimhen then wrapped up with a spectacular finish against AS Roma in Napoli’s final game in January. His performances did not go unnoticed, as he earned a nomination for the player of the month alongside compatriot Ademola Lookman; Paulo Dybala, Lautaro Martinez, and Luis Alberto. The Serie A revealed on Friday that Osimhen beat the other four nominees to claim the award for the best player in January. He is the third Napoli player to win the Serie A player of the month this season after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia and Kim Min-Jae. The 24-year-old Nigerian striker will receive his award when Napoli welcomes Cremonese on Sunday.
