From John Adams/Yunusa Umar, Minna Tragedy struck on Monday evening when a fuel tanker crushed to death a yet-to-be-identified student of Niger State College of Education, Mokwa campus, in Mokwa Local Government Area of the state. The accident occurred at about 5pm on Monday, when the deceased was said to be returning from school, riding on a motorcycle, and carrying a fellow student. A witness account noted that the deceased had attempted to overtake the tanker trailer when suddenly he saw an oncoming vehicle and in an attempt to avoid the vehicle, lost control and entered the tanker trailer, and was crushed to death. The eyewitness, who was at the scene of the accident when it occurred, told Daily Sun that the deceased lost control of his motorcycle out of panic, due to the over speeding by the oncoming vehicle which caused him to swerve from the road and enter in between the trailer. The deceased student died on the spot while his fellow student, however, sustained injury and is currently being treated at a government medical facility in Mokwa. The Niger State Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) official at Mokwa, Mr. Kumar Tsukwam, confirmed the incident, saying that the accident involved two vehicles and a motorcycle.   He pointed out that the deceased students and a colleague were returning home from school after writing their exams when the crash occurred. “The family of the deceased was at the crash scene and they insisted the body should be released to them, which we did, while men of the Nigeria Police Force were on the scene for their investigation. From what we gathered, the victim was coming from Government Teachers College (GTC) Mokwa, which is along the main road where the crash occurred after writing his NCE exams.”
