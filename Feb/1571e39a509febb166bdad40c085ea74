The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) disclosed on Tuesday that its ability to conduct the 2023 general elections may be hampered by the Central Bank of Nigeriaâ€™s (CBN) cashless policy. FCT Resident Electoral Commissioner Yahaya Bello made this known while speaking at the North-Central Stakeholders Roundtable on the 2023 General Elections which was organized by the Centre for Transparency Advocacy (CTA) in Abuja. Bello said the Commission needs cash to enable it to coordinate security and logistics and that the scarcity of the Naira may affect this.
