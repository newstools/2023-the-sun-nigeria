Nigerian football legend, Ahmed Musa has settled the hospital bills of more than N2.5million for patients at the Male Surgical ward of the Aminu Kano Teaching hospital. The Super Eagles captain is known to always give to society considering what he has done for years and keeps doing to help people on the streets. At the Surgical ward of the Aminu hospital, Musa was touched by the conditions of those on the beds and decided to help them financially. The former Premier League star then spoke with the authority of the hospital so as to know the amount to be paid for each patient for effective transfer of money. Speaking exclusively to Sports Brief, Musa explained that he did what was done for Allah and not for the people, claiming that the Almighty is the owner of everything. “I did not do it for people, I did it because of Allah, who is the owner of everything and I wish all of them quick recovery,” he said. Musa also settled bills of other patients in other wards in the hospital and gave relatives of those on the bed the sum of N20, 000 each. Earlier, Sports Brief had reported how Ahmed Musa posted an adorable picture of himself stepping out in style while urging his fans around the world to always show appreciation to people who have made a difference in their lives. The Super Eagles captain made this known days after escaping the earthquake in Turkey which killed many people, amongst them former Ghana international, Christian Atsu.
