The Lagos State Police Command has read the riot acts to mischief makers not to foment trouble in the State or risked the wrath of the Force. The warning comes as a result of intelligence indicating some groups of persons want to take advantage of the new Naira notes scarcity to unleash violence in some parts of the State. In a statement by Lagos State Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO) SP Benjamin Hundeyin, “The Command, hereby, warns the groups to shelve their planned violence or have the full weight of the law to contend with. “Lagos State residents and visitors are enjoined not to panic as the Police, in conjunction with other security agencies, embark on confidence-building patrols across the Lagos metropolis. “In the meantime, all law-abiding Lagosians are encouraged to go about their lawful duties without any fear of harassment or intimidation as the Command has ensured the optimal deployment of human and operational resources towards guaranteeing their safety and security.”
