From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja the All Progressives Congress (APC) has told President Muhammadu Buhari to respect the ruling of the Supreme Court and direct the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, to end the current currency swap policy that has imposed untold hardship on Nigerians.  A member of the ruling party’s National Working Committee (NWC) and Zonal Chairman North-West, Salihu Moh Lukman, in a statement wondered why the party has not convened an emergency National Executive Committee (NEC) in the face of the challenges of grave consequences confronting the electoral fortunes of the party.  He expressed optimism that APC would win the elections, but noted that the party would have to work even more harder to ensure the next government led by Bola Tinubu come with more listening ears to Nigerians and fellow party leaders. He also prayed that if he wins, the Tinubu-led APC government must be a remarkable improvement on the President Buhari-led government. The former director-general of the APC Progressive Governors Forum (PGF) also warned that once party organs seized to be decision making platforms, the domineering control of government institutions by so-called cabals would remain strong. “In all of these, it needs to be clearly stated that throughout the tenure of President Buhari, nothing tests his credential as a converted democrat more than the need to demonstrate more listening ears and compassion at the plight of Nigerians. “As a converted democrat, which I believe he is, President Buhari needs to demonstrate that by respecting the Supreme Court judgement and direct the CBN to end the current madness that imposes Naira scarcity in the country and untold hardship for millions of Nigerians,” he wrote.
