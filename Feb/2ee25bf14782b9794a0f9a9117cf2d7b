From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS), Sunday evening arrested the Abia State Resident Electorial Commisioner (REC) of the Independent National Electorial Commission (INEC), Chijioke Uzochukwu for absconding from his duty post. It was gathered that Ezeani was arrested on Sunday, after he went into hiding in a hotel in Umuahia after the Presidential and National Assembly elections held in Abia State. A source told  this reporter that Uzochukwu was picked up in his hotel room after the DSS broke the door of the room following his refusal to open the door when he was asked to do so. The source said following the REC’s arrest, the INEC Director of Admin in the state was mandated to take over the election process in the state. The source said, “He has been in hiding and not picking calls. The National chairman has tried to reach him several times but he is not picking. “There is confusion in Abia state, so the REC went into hiding at Hotel Royal Damgrete. The DSS broke into his room after knocking on the door several times and he refused to open. The director of admin of INEC has been asked to take over”, the source said. It could be recalled that since after the election on Saturday, no official result has been announced in Abia state, perhaps, as a result of the REC’s action.
