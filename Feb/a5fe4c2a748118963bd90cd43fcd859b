From Okey Sampson, Umuahia The Abia state Governorship candidate of Action Alliance (AA), Onyekwere Akym Uche (OAU) said he joined the gubernatorial race to give the state a new hope. Uche who stated this during his governoship declaration in Umuahia, said the state needed to be rescued from her present political servitude and economic emasculation. The AA governoship hopeful said he had come to change the narrative of the state from that of underdevelopment and retrogression, to that of a progressive and a pacesetter state. “I have taken time to understudy and analyse the goings-on and the deplorable state of affairs in Abia state, and came to a factual conclusion that the major challenge in the state is bad leadership. “Those who were privileged to superintend over the affairs of the state, did not only abuse the opportunities given to them to positively affect lives, but regrettably embarked on insatiable chase for wealth”. Uche regretted that public schools are today at their lowest ebb, stressing that if not for private schools, the state could have topped the list of educationally disadvantaged states in the country. He lamented the pathetic condition of workers and pensioners in the state, some of who he said are owed several months of salary arrears and promised to wipe away their tears if he becomes the governor of the state. He equally rued the conditions of higher institutions in the state, some of which he said have lost their accreditation at one point or the other as a result of poor funding. The AA governoship candidate who promised to turn things around for good in the state, pointed out that funds to achieve the infrastructural development of the state will not be problem as he promised to use his international connections to attract funds from world financial institutions.
