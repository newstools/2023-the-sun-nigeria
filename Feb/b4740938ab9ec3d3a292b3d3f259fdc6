From Emmanuel Adeyemi, Lokoja Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu has promised to make Kogi State the industrial hub of Nigeria if voted into power. He stated this, yesterday, at Confluence Stadium, Lokoja during the APC rally, describing the state as richly endowed in mineral and human resources. He promised to complete the moribund Ajaokuta Steel company and provide employment opportunities for millions of youths if elected. He also promised to provide qualitative education and comprehensive health care for citizens and ensure speedy industrialization of the country. Tinubu urged the electorate to troop out  enmass and vote all candidates of the ruling party in the forthcoming  elections. He also urged the electorate in the state to carefully study the pedigree of all the presidential candidates and vote for him as the best and most prepared among the major contenders.  Kogi State Governor, Yahaya Bello said in 2019 the state delivered  95 per cent votes to President Muhammadu Buhari,  but that for Tinubu he would get 100 per cent of the votes. He said his administration has done far better than other administrations before him, which made the APC the preferred political party in the state.
