•Helps team out of relegation zone By Bolaji Okunola Leicester City striker, Kelechi Iheanacho again proved his worth by netting and creating two assists in his side’s Premier League 4-2 away victory against Aston Villa. Having created an assist to level up scores in the12th minute, the 26-year old achieved greater feat by heading home a 44th minutes equalizer. He continued with his enviable form by creating another few seconds to half time to give the Foxes a deserving victory. With his efforts before being substituted by Jamie Vardy, the Brendan Rodgers lads were able to sneak out of the relegation zone to maintain 13th position on the log. Meanwhile, the in-form attacker, last weekend netted a loan goal against Walsall to inspire his team to the quarter final stage of the English FA Cup. He will be bracing up for more when Leicester host Tottenham next weekend at the King Power Stadium.
