From Magnus Eze, Enugu The industrial town of Nnewi, Anambra State, last Saturday, played host to the Jamaican High Commissioner to Nigeria, Esmond Reid.  Reid who was in company of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Geoffrey Onyeama, during a facility tour of Innoson Vehicles Manufacturing (IVM) plant, revealed plans by his country to start importing vehicles from the Nigerian motor company: “For us, it is a tremendous opportunity to witness vehicle manufacturing taking place here in Nigeria, which is one of our brothers in the south.  “It is also an opportunity to be able to discuss commercial opportunities for sourcing vehicles from Nigeria. “This is my first visit. I will go and consult with my stakeholders back home to look at the timeline and determine the negotiations and engagements and when we will start the business of sourcing the vehicles.” Also, Onyeama called for the strict enforcement of the Presidential Executive Order mandating government officials to buy and use Nigerian cars: “I’m very proud. This plant is world class, compared to some of the vehicle manufacturing companies I have seen in some other countries. Innoson is doing well. “Left to me, every government official should be obliged to buy and use a Nigerian manufactured car. “That order has to be imposed and made mandatory. In France, it is impossible to see a French government official driving a non French car, same in the Japan, Korea, UK and US. “We have to do the same here. This will encourage and support our citizens and demystify technology.” Onyeama said he facilitated the visit to IVM when the Jamaican High Commission requested to see the impressive things going on in Nigeria. Chairman of IVM, Chief Innocent Chukwuma appreciated the Federal Government for supporting manufacturing companies in the country and urged Nigerians to always patronise his products as he assured them of quality and durable vehicles.
