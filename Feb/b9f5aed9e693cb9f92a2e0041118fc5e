Finidi George has charged defenders of other clubs in the Nigeria Premier Football League to be scared of his lethal striker Emeka Obioma, as he’s unstoppable when it comes to goal-scoring, BSNSports.com.ng reports. The goal poacher hit a brace against the Shooting Stars on Matchday 8, to take his season goal tally to seven with none scored from the spot kick. Finidi, Super Eagles assistant coach said: “Obioma should have scored more goals against 3SC, we are happy for him. “Anything he touches goes in and we’re expecting a hat trick from him against Shooting Stars but that didn’t happen, maybe in the next game. “Great form he’s got, and his attitude is perfect and brilliant. We keep encouraging and pushing him to get the best out of him.” On the People’s Elephants play against Shooting Stars: “I must commend my players as they showed character, they did well despite a lot of pressure in the game. “The team also created chances and they deserved the 3 points.” Finidi also fancied Enyimba’s chances of finishing among the playoff teams. “If you want to go places you have to be solid at the back, the players are doing that and it will take us to where we want to be. “Not only at the defenders but all the players. Now the belief is there, the results are coming and we’re all happy.” The Aba Millionaires will be guests to Insurance in a Matchday 9 top-of-the-table fixture at the Ogbe Stadium in Benin City on Sunday.
