From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja  Atiku/Okowa Campaign Organisation has said the alleged resort to violent attacks against Nigerians by All Progressives Congress ( APC) would not help the party in the February 25 presidential election. The campaign, in a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, described the alleged attacks as an inexcusable act of cowardice. It noted that rather than accept their alleged rejection by Nigerians, the APC was allegedly unleashing violence on innocent Nigerians. “It is clear that the purpose of this attack is to instil fear, foist a siege mentality on Nigerians and create voter apathy by making our nation to appear unsafe for Nigerians to come out and vote.” It said that explained why the All APC presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, did not sign the first National Peace Accord, as well as the establishment of the Jagaban Army. The campaign, while commending Nigerians for their courage, charged the security agencies to go after those behind the attacks, as well as protect innocent citizens from further attacks.
