Surely billionaire entrepreneur and philanthropist, Tony Onyemaechi Elumelu is not your regular wealthy dude. The Chairman, Heirs Holdings understands the science of money and power. He knows how to make money and enjoy life to the fullest. At almost 60 —birthday is on March 22— Elumelu still got the vibes, drip and all. He is known to be a stylish man who is living his best life.  His stories on his social media handles say it all. With over 867,000 followers on Instagram and more than 405,000 following on FaceBook, the holder of multiple national honours is an inspiration to many on social media with intentional posts on fine living and business – and motivational quotes. And indeed, Elumelu lives all the things he posts on social media about good conduct.   A certain guest who stumbled on the extraordinary businessman at Da Vinci, the fancy restaurant at The George Hotel on Lugard Avenue, Ikoyi, Lagos validated this billionaire’s unusual positive traits. The Chairman of UBA was spotted dining at the leisure place preferred by the people of means in the company of his wife, Dr. Awele. According to the guest —who was in the company of a patron of the diner, who was familiar with Elumelu, but didn’t know him— the super investor was super courteous and exchanged pleasantries. Elumelu and his wife were nearer the entrance of the diner, but the clincher was that, after their meal, the power couple came to return the courtesy as they walked down to bid the man a farewell at his table which was further down the hall. “The reality is that the person I was with is below the Elumelus’ social and financial ladder and I was a stranger to them but they were very gracious. They particularly came to return the courtesy we extended to them and I find this charming because I have been with others there and seen other well-to-do persons including people who are nowhere near Elumelu’s status, take such things as their entitlements and just walk off,” said the guest.
