Kelechi Iheanacho insists Leicester needs to “give more” after its thrilling comeback win at Aston Villa. The Foxes went into the game with only a goal difference keeping them outside the Premier League relegation zone but turned in a scintillating display that saw the team leave Villa Park with a 4-2 victory. An Ollie Watkins strike and an own goal from Harry Souttar – on his Leicester debut – twice had Unai Emery’s Villa ahead, but they were pegged back by James Maddison and Iheanacho. Tete, also making his Leicester bow, put the visitors in front at the break before substitute Dennis Praet wrapped up the win.  “It’s been a little while,” Iheanacho told LCFC TV of Leicester’s first league win since November.  “But getting this win now, we’re happy, and we can build into the next games. Hopefully we can continue in those games. We had a good feeling coming into this game.  “We need to do a bit more. It was a good performance, but we need to give more, running forward and back, challenging for first balls and second balls, winning battles.  “There’s a lot of things to work on, but hopefully it’s good momentum for the next games.  “With the new guys coming into the game, they did really well today as well. We know what we have to do now.”
