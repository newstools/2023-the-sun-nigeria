From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu Movement for the Actualisation of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB) has expressed concern over the increasing attack on members of opposition political parties in Ebonyi and Imo states, warning that the attacks and killings must stop forthwith. The group has also warned governments of two affected states to stop the alleged “increasing intimidations, harassments and killings of the citizens of their respective states  because of their political differences.” In a statement issued yesterday by the National Director of Information, Edeson Samuel, the group stated that the people would not forgive any politician who shed blood while in office. “The governors of Ebonyi and Imo states  have forgotten that in less than six months and  14 months respectively, their political tenures shall elapse and they will be dragged to International Criminal Court of justice  over the heinous crime, they committed against humanity and  citizens of their respective states. Why must they kill because they want to remain in power. “MASSOB wish to make it clear that any politician in Igbo land who kill our people will  be banished after  he may have gone out of office.” MASSOB further accused the governments of Ebonyi and Imo states of using Ebubeagu Security Outfit  after the candidates of Labour Party (LP), All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) and the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ebonyi State while in Imo State, candidates of PDP, APGA and LP were suffering same persecutions and mesmerisation.  “It is very unfortunate that the security agents in Ebonyi and Imo states cannot protect the innocent citizens of these states, and none of the criminals used to perpetrate these crimes has been arrested because they are working for their states’ government.”
