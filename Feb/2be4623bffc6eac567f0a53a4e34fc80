From Agaju Madugba, Katsina Katsina State Governor Aminu Bello Masari has ordered the immediate termination of appointments of the Commissioner for Works and Housing, Tasi’u Dahiru Dandagoro, the Permanent Secretary, Sustainable Development, Fatima Ahmed, and her counterpart at the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Aminu Waziri. In a press statement on Monday, signed by the Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Muntari Lawal, Masari also sacked the Chairman, Katsina State Pilgrims Welfare Board, Yusuf Barmo. A competent Government House source hinted that the Governor’s action may not be unconnected with the defeat of the All Progressives Congress (APC) presidential candidate, Asiwaju Ahmed Bola Tinubu, in Katsina during last Saturday’s presidential polls. Tinubu, who polled 482,283 votes, lost to the People’s Democratic Party candidate, Atiku Abubakar, who received a total of 489,045 votes from across the 34 Local Government Areas of the state. The source said that “there is no doubt that government reviewed and is still reviewing roles of various persons that culminated in the party’s defeat in the state.” But the SSG in his statement said that dismissal of the officers was done, “in the move to make some strategic re-alignments. “All the affected political/public office holders are directed to hand over all government property in their possession to the reflective permanent secretaries or the most senior director as the case may be.”
