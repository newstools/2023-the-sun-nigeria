Tottenham Hotspur turned the heat on Graham Potter after ousting his limp Chelsea side 2-0 in a fiercely-contested London derby. Oliver Skipp’s scorching strike 30 seconds into the second half and a neat effort from Harry Kane fired Spurs to victory and gave them a four-point cushion in fourth place.  The hosts continued their good home form under the stewardship of first-team coach, Cristian Stellini to boost their Champions League ambitions, as Antonio Conte recovers from an operation to remove his gallbladder. Chelsea looks in need of surgery, with Potter now on a bleak run of three successive losses. The under-fire boss has seen his men score just one goal in their last six games and win just one of their 11 matches in 2023. The Blues could still count themselves fortunate to have 11 players on the pitch, though, as Hakim Ziyech saw his first-half red card for a shove on Emerson Royal overturned after a puzzling call from referee Stuart Attwell. The Blues’ Mr Reliable since he signed from Paris Saint-Germain in the summer of 2020, the battle-hardened Thiago Silva rarely wilts when faced with injury. This time out, however, a knock to the knee in attempting to stop Harry Kane charging at goal saw him substituted after just 19 minutes, as the 38-year-old defender couldn’t play through the pain in a blow to Graham Potter. Fortunately for £75million summer signing Wesley Fofona, he was able to replace him from the bench, having played a mere 45 minutes of first-team football since October 5. The French centre-back, still only 22, has been plagued by injuries both this season and his last at Leicester City, and Silva’s injury could present him with an opportunity to nail down a place in Potter’s rather ramshackle defence.
