• Warns against interference with Rivers votes From Bamigbola Gbolagunte, Akure and Tony John, Port Harcourt National Chairman of the Action Alliance (AA), Dr. Adekunle Omoaje, has said the exclusion of the party from Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections forced the party to boycott it. Omoaje, who berated INEC’s flagrant disobedience to court orders that compelled it to recognise the candidates he submitted, noted that plan of the electoral umpire was to frustrate the party and also jeopardize the nation’s democracy. He said leaders of the party had resolved to boycott the election after efforts to prevail on INEC to recognise its candidates failed. However, Omoaje, declared that the party would challenge the outcome of the elections at the tribunal as INEC failed to respect all the court orders in favour of the party. Meanwhile, governorship candidate of the AA in Rivers State, Dawari George, has warned against any act of interference with the will of Rivers people as expressed in last Saturday’s elections.  George, in an address to Rivers people, expressed concerns over reports of attempts by some people to subvert the will of the people as expressed in their voting preference.  He called on politicians, state and non-state actors not to interfere with the will of Rivers people, or tamper with the votes that had been cast by the people.  He said  the presidential election was of great significance to the future of the country and the state, and was important every citizen is heard and respected.  He reminded those who seek to subvert the will of the people that Nigeria’s democracy is built on the principle of power of the people and that as such, it was important everyone respects the sanctity of the ballot box.
