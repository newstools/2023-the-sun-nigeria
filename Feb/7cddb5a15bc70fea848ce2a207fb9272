Sani in company with his running mate, Dr. Okey Udo, while addressing the crowd that came to receive him at the party office in Owerri, identified both challenges as the country’s greatest problems, while describing corruption as a setback. The ADP presidential candidate flayed the redesigning of the naira note by the Federal Government, describing it as “ill timed.” “We can’t believe we are still queuing for fuel and queuing for naira notes at the banks; it is ill timed, and this is the scenario we want to change: a new Nigeria of our dreams where the youths would be greatly employed, no more fear of attacks; we can achieve these if you vote for me. “As the largest country in black Africa, Nigeria is well positioned to be the rallying point for global issues such as climate change, energy transition and information technology. “ADP is a child of necessity; we came to the rescue of Nigerian people, and we have brought the intervention in the midst of divisions in major political parties.  “We are the credible alternative. We know the pains of Nigerians and the solutions. We will harness Nigeria’s large gas deposits, sand and wind mills as well as hydro-power to create employment as a solution to insecurity. While explaining why he started his campaign in the Southeast, Sani said: “Igbo people are “very enterprising; that is why I chose to kick start my campaign in Owerri, because I always placed a high premium on Imo and Igbo people in general.” This, he said, informed his choice of an Igbo, Udo, as his running mate.
