From Charity Nwakaudu, Abuja The Middle Belt Youth Wing has vowed to make sure that the votes of Nigerians count in the forthcoming general elections. National Leader of the group, Emma Zopmal stated this in a statement he released to journalists in Abuja yesterday. He lamented that the Nigerian youths are tired of recycling of same old politicians who are responsible of dragging the country backward. “We want to state categorically that we will not allow any cabal of rigging elections in Nigeria to tamper with mandate of Nigerian youths in the coming election. Enough of recycling same old elements of darkness and backwardness in governance. We are ready to defend our votes anytime and we will synchronise our efforts with other sociocultural youth groups in Nigeria to defend the mandate of the electorates.We encourage the Independent National Electoral Commission to beef up mechanisms for eliminating any election rigging plans. This election is crucial to Nigerians like in 2015 General Elections. The country is on the verge of transition again to a new leadership which will pilot the affairs of this country at home and on the global stage. We are willing to partner with INEC in ensuring transparent, credible, free and fair elections. We call on the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr. Peter Obi, to step up his engagements across the country, especially where his votes are targeted to be rigged out. Without blocking these leakages, he should rest assured that his votes will be manipulated by authors of rigging election in Nigeria. Don’t say at the end of the day that we didn’t give you early warning signs. We urge all security agencies to see all eligible voters on the day of the election as citizens of the Federal Republic of Nigeria not as citizens of any political party. The balanced role you will play in these elections will determine the kind of country we will all live in after the elections. “
