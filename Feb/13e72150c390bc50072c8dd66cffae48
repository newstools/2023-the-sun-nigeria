From Fred Itua, Abuja A Civil Society Organisation, African Centre for Justice and Human Rights (ACJHR), has called on the Inspector-General of Police, Usman Alkali Baba to identify policemen who allegedly joined masked gunmen to attack the House of PDP Ideato North South federal constituency, House of Representatives candidate Ikenga Ugochinyere, shooting, detaining and destroying properties. On January 14th in Akokwa, Imo State, motorcades conveying the gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s House, burnt his house, cars and killed his uncle and three others. While the police has sadly been silent on this matter, again, on Tuesday masked gunmen invaded Ugochinyere’s house with explosives. The group in a statement by its strategic communication consultant Comrade Abubakar Isa wondered why the operatives of the Nigerian Police allegedly in collaboration with the state backed private militia invaded Ikenga’s home. This attack, according to the rights group is another violation of the right to life and free speech of the CUPP spokesman. The statement reads: “We call on the Inspector General of Police, to prevail on Governor Hope Uzodinma and the security chiefs in Imo to rein in these gunmen creating tension in the state and fear in Ideato in particular. “We also appeal to them to create the appropriate environment for a free and fair poll, retrace their steps and point their gun nozzles at the criminals ravaging the state and not at Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere – a law abiding citizen who is always in the public space, and not hidden from security or public glare.”
