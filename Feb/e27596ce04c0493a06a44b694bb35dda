By Kenneth Udeh Chief Whip of the Senate, Orji Uzor Kalu, has bagged the 2022 Most Outstanding Development-Driven Senator award by Nigerian Union of Journalists (NUJ) and Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria (FRCN), Abuja Chapters. In a letter dated February 20, the organisations said it found Kalu, who is representing Abia-North deserving of the award given the massive infrastructural and empowerment projects attracted to his zone in his first term at the Senate. Notifying Kalu on his nomination, the letter signed by NUJ’s Chapel Chairperson, Shakirat Alabi, said the lawmaker would  be bestowed with the award at its event billed to hold in Abuja, on March 1, at the National Press Centre, Radio House, Abuja. The letter cosigned by NUJ’s Secretary, Ifeanyi Osita and its Chairman Organising Committee, Matthew Ayoola said the award was “in recognition of your performance on account of a series of development projects you have carried out in your constituency, which among others include roads rehabilitation /construction , water boreholes installation, construction of primary health care centers and series of empowerment programs.” The latest honour adds to an array of highly coveted awards bagged by Kalu, a first time Senator since he was elected into the Senate in 2019 owing to his infrastructural and human empowerment drive in his constituency. Kalu had twice in a row clinched the awards of the Senate Press Corps in “constituency development” and “Overall Best Senator in Constituency Projects and Human Relations Award”. In 2022 the former Abia Governor received the prize as the “Best Senator of the Year Award” at the highly rated Leadership Excellence Awards in Abuja.
