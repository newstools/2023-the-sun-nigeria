The Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) has commiserated with the government and people of Turkey and Syria over the devastating earthquake that consumed over 22,000 lives in both countries. In a statement, IPOB’s spokesman, Emma Powerful said the group sympathized with both countries for the devastation and loss of lives. “We pray to God Almighty to give you all the fortitude to bear the loss. We send our sincere condolences to the government of Turkey and Syria and the individual families that lost their loved ones during the earthquake. We condole with you and pray that such will not happen again. The loss of lives can only be described as tragic. We call on the international community, neighbouring countries, and the United Nations to provide humanitarian support to Syria and Turkey and their citizens.” The group also called on IPOB members in Turkey and Syria to be vigilant as they prayed that God would protect them and their families at this critical time.  “We advise other IPOB family members across the globe to regularly call and check on the welfare of our fellow comrades in these two countries,” the statement said.
