We have campaigned for the past five months, and we have seen firsthand what bad governance has done to our society, poverty and insecurity staring at us, but I also saw that our people were seeking a government that would bring them comfort; the Labour Party was that party.    “As a party, we knew the people were with us and we would win, and we were also certain the other parties would use violence or whatever vice they could concoct to subvert the will of the people. We saw pockets of this in Oredo here in Edo State and on a large scale in Lagos and River”, he added.
