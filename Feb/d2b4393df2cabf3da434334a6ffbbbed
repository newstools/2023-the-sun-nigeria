The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, has pledged to improve the country’s foreign reserve. He also promised to promote the export of goods and services to boost Nigeria’s foreign reserves rather than focus on importation that drains foreign reserves. The LP presidential candidate, who appeared on Lagos based television programme, assured Nigerians that he would change the economic system of the country from consumption to production. Obi promised to deal with the security challenge and ensure farmers return to their farms to produce export-oriented goods. “We will move from consumption to production. We will ensure the security of lives and property, increase agricultural productivity and this will increase Nigeria’s foreign reserve.” Obi made reference to Aba footwear makers and tailors and pledged to support them, adding, “imagine if we can increase our export of footwear to other countries and the foreign exchange that will come from this trade.” On his campaign in Lagos, Obi said Oba of Lagos palace officials told his campaign team that the monarch was not available to receive him when he visited Lagos.
