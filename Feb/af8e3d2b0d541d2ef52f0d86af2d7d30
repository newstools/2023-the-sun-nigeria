On Valentine’s Day, Infinix Nigeria took its love for fans and consumers to the next level by partnering premium jewelry brand, Bozjewelry; event company, Finesseevents and Whitestoneplace.  The brand made the Valentine’s Day extra special by sponsoring the proposal idea of a lucky customer, Michael, allowing him to not only change the status of his sweetheart from girlfriend to fiancée, but also express his love for her in the most memorable way. Olabisi, the bride-to-be, who was unaware of what was in stock for her, arrived at Whitestone Place, Oregun, Ikeja, Lagos thinking she was attending a normal Valentine’s event, but she was greeted with a beautiful romantic scenery. All Michael had to do was go down on one knee and propose with the beautiful diamond ring from Boz Jewelry, and he got a resounding yes. The evening was filled with love and happiness, and the couple was not only surrounded by the warmth and beauty of the moment, but also by a few family and friends. The couple, who have dated for nine years, was overwhelmed with emotions as they expressed their gratitude to Infinix for sponsoring their proposal event. The smartphone brand is currently running a Valentine’s promo where lucky customers stand a chance to win N350,000 shopping spree for themselves and loved ones, just by buying any Infinix device from an authorized retail outlet nationwide. Customers will also get up to 20% discounts and win gifts instantly. The Infinix Valentine’s promo ends on February 23.
