By Christian Agadibe Nollywood actor, Joseph Okechukwu tied the knot with his fiancée quietly on February 4, 2023, his birthday and then splashed the wedding photos on social media. While a handful of fans sent the couple warm congratulations and prayers, many questioned the circumstances in which they chose to downplay what was supposed to be a celebrity event.  Offering an explanation, Okechukwu said: “I sincerely didn’t want my marriage to be publicised. I wanted it as private as possible, but it went beyond me. This is why many people close to me were not carried along. But now that it’s out there, if there’s anything that must be reported, it should be that I dated my wife for nearly two years, and we never had sex for once.”  He continued: “This is in line with my Christian principles and not a selfish, glory-provoking stunt, and I urge young people, especially Christians, to imbibe this. There is so much joy, safety, preservation and prosperity in obeying God through sexual purity in your premarital relationships.   “Most often than not, when you open yourself up to premarital sex, things quickly spiral out of control, and you wonder why. I’m not about to preach, but opening doors before marriage that you should only open after the wedding could open your relationship up to very hostile, unfriendly, often inexplicable and sometimes insurmountable disruptions.  “It’s because sex or lovemaking isn’t as simple and ordinary as many of us think. Profound spiritual mysteries and mind boggling emotional complexities are involved. Just wait obediently and patiently. That way also, you’ll know who’s yours and who’s not.”
