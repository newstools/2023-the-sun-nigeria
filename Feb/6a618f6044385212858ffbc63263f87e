Former Edo State commissioner for Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs, Lucky James, has described Francis Alimikhena as a brilliant, forthright and vibrant parliamentarian with vision that has laid the roadmap and developmental templates for the overall development of Edo North. James, who was also the former local government chairman of Etsako West, further described Alimikhena as the springboard that can launch Edo North to greater heights.  He said the coast is clear for Alimikhena in the Edo North senatorial election, based on the strength of his performance in the past years.  James said Alimikhena has demonstrated a clinical understanding of the Edo North developmental challenge and also displayed the political will in combating them.  “He is not in the senatorial race to seek employment but to render impactful service to humanity.  “Edo North has never had it so good. Even those contesting the senatorial election with him have also joined in sharing the testimony of the enormous patience of Alimikhena in listening to the people and being accessible by the masses,” James said.  James, who is the director general of Alimikhena’s campaign organisation, said the organisation has embarked upon a focused and issue-based campaign.  He said Alimikhena has employed his astute brilliance and dogged determination in ensuring that Edo North is not left in the hands of political merchants.  In a statement through the Director of Media in the campaign Organization, Benjamin Atu, the former commissioner called on all well-meaning Edo North leaders to come together and join hands to collapse the empire of former governor Adams Oshiomhole in the forthcoming Edo North senatorial election, to end oppression and deprivation in Edo North from the grip of a dictator.  “We must collectively resist politics for succour and personal rehabilitation,” he said.
