• In Serie A’s top scorer • Matches Higuain, Cavani feat after brace • Climbs into the crowd to apologise to young fan Victor Osimhen scored twice on Sunday to power Napoli to a fine 3-0 win away to Spezia in what is the league leader’s 18th victory of the Italian Serie A campaign. Nigerian attacker, Ademola Lookman had looked like the only striker who can keep up with the goalscoring consistency of Osimhen in Italy this term, with the Atalanta ace finding the back of the net 12 times. And a few days ago, the former Leicester City forward voiced his conviction that he would outscore Osimhen by the end of the season. But Osimhen has not taken the challenge lightly as he extended his lead at the goals chart to four following his brace at the Stadio Alberto Picco. After Khvicha Kvaratskhelia handed Napoli the lead from the penalty spot minutes into the second half, Osimhen rose high to nod in his first of the afternoon in the 68th minute. The Super Eagles striker added the third goal of the match five minutes later to take his tally for the season to 16 league goals. With his double against Spezia, Osimhe joins Luis Vinicio, Edinson Cavani, and Gonzalo Higuaín in becoming the fourth Napoli player to score 16 goals in the first 21 Serie A games of a season.
