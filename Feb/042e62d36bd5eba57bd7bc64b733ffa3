From Femi Folaranmi, Yenagoa Bayelsa Governor, Douye Diri, has picked a nomination form to seek re-election as governor on the platform of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). A source said one of the several support groups canvassing for Diri to run for second term had purchased the governorship forms for the governor. Findings indicated that Diri as a mark of respect has informed his predecessor, Seriake Dickson, of his intention to seek re-election. A principal officer in the Bayelsa State House of Assembly and a close associate of the governor also confirmed that nomination form has been picked for the governor. Barring any last minute surprises, Diri is expected to run for the ticket of the PDP unopposed as there is nobody willing to challenge him for the ticket. According to the 2023 gubernatorial primary/candidate nomination time-table for Bayelsa, Imo and Kogi released by the leadership of the PDP indicated that the sales of expression of interest and nomination forms commenced on January 16 and ended on January 31. The time-table stated that the last day for the submission of expression of interest and nomination was on February 6 while screening of aspirants is slated for February 13 at the national secretariat. Recently a Bayelsa-based non-government organisation, Ward 2 Ward 4 Diri/Law 2023 raised N28.4 million for the re-election bid of Diri, threatening to drag him to court if he refused to contest. Several support groups backing Diri’s re-election said the governor should run for consolidation and continuity.   During the Yuletide season, Diri had declared he was going to seek re-election with his deputy, Lawrence Ewhrudjakpo.
