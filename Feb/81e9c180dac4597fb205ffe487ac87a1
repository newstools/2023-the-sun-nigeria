Arsenal and Manchester City have both been charged by the Football Association for failing to control their players in Wednesday’s topof-the-table Premier League clash. Citizen stars twice surrounded referee Anthony Taylor during their crucial 3-1 win at the Emirates, once just before half-time and the other on 64 minutes. Gunners players did the same in the 56th minute, as Mikel Arteta’s title favourites surrendered their position as league leaders on goal difference. An FA statement alleges both clubs failed to ensure their players behaved in an orderly fashion.  The sides now have until February 21 to respond to the charge. The FA statement read: “Arsenal and Manchester City have been charged after their players surrounded the match official at different times during the Premier League fixture on Wednesday 15 February. “It’s alleged that both clubs failed to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion, with Arsenal’s players surrounding the match official during the 56th minute, and Manchester City’s doing so during the 42nd and 64th minutes. “Both clubs have until Tuesday 21 February to provide their respective responses.”
