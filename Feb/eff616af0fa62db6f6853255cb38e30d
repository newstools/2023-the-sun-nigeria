From Lateef Dada, Osogbo  Aare Ona Kakanfo of Yorubaland, Gani Adams, yesterday, called on the Governors of Osun, Ekiti, and Ogun States, Ademola Adeleke, Biodun Oyebamiji, and Dapo Abiodun, to empower the South West  Security Network (Amotekun corps) and local organisations to arrest rising cases of kidnapping in the region.   Speaking at the annual Oodua festival in Ile-Ife, Osun State, Adams said the region had the potential to achieve results in security by effectively engaging Amotekun corps. He commended Oyo and Ondo States for being up and doing in funding the Amotekun operatives, stressing the need for other states to emulate them. “They should empower the local organisations and Amotekun. They will complement the effort of the police and other security agencies. Security is not about the government alone. All hands must be on deck to make sure we have adequate security. The government should coordinate local organisations, Amotekun, and Nigeria police to achieve a very good result.  “The governors have their way of solving their problem. Oyo state boosted the Amotekun, mobilised up to three thousand, and gave them all equipment and they have been doing well. “In Oyo and Ondo states Amotekun is doing well but in Ekiti, Osun, and Ogun, the Amotekun is not noticeable. Lagos state is not doing it. We have to use what we have to achieve what we want,” he said.
