The final of the first Navaney Foundation Women Soccer Tournament, which held at the Nathaniel Idowu Unity Primary School pitch at the weekend in Ajegunle, saw Aseyori Queens from Abeokuta, in Ogun State clinching the trophy, with prize money of a N100, 000. The organisers of the event, Navaney Foundation, based in far away Durblin, Ireland said they were happy with the turnout and the manner the girls coordinated themselves though out the competition. Chairman of the foundation, Chief John Akpan said he decided to embark on the project to see how he can positively occupy the minds of young girls and make them better people in the society. “Growing up as a child in Ajegunle was not only tough but risky. It’s an environment where survival rate is low. I feel it’s appropriate to return to the environment I had my childhood and see how I can, in my own little way, help develop young people. We have abundant talents and these few days have really proven that. We have the names and contact of those who did exceptionally well and we are going to get in touch with them. It’s painful that our team from Ajegunle got trashed at the early stage of the competition, but it’s all good that we got a winner. We are going to be doing this every year, with other charitable events as the year unfolds,” he said. Coordinator of the event, Emmanuel Etu said trophies, cash, medals and other gifts where given out to players. “We also have awards to some who have over the years made us proud in the game of football. They are Peter Nieketein, Ifeanyi Udeze, Louis Maduku, Emmanuel Etu, Jude Mbachu, McAnthony Anelechukwu and Andrew Okafor,” he said
