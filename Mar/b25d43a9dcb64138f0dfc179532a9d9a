Also, all the vehicles parked in the compound were set ablaze,” he said. “I have reported it to the police and I expect them to come to my aid as well as ensure that those behind this unfortunate, barbaric and inhumane act are arrested to face the consequence of their actions.” However, when contacted, the spokesperson of the state police command state Henry Okoye ( ASP) said he was yet to be briefed about the incident and promised to respond as soon as possible.
