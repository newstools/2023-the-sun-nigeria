Fast rising singer, Babalola Babatunde also known as Scope The Entertainer, has released his first musical project, an Extended Play titled, Sound From The New Street. The Lagos-born artiste in an encounter with Saturday Sun shed more lights on his kind of music. “Sound From The New Street is my first body of work, an introduction to my sound and style of music that I want the world to use to connect with me. My sound is unique, so original. I’m bringing another sound from the new street. This is a new street from the streets. I love the streets because I was born and raised in there. I can tell my life story through music,” he stated. On what inspired the 6-track EP, Scope The Entertainer noted that it’s his life journey and other issues. “Realities and my life generally inspired this project. Most of the songs that were part of the EP have been recorded since 2020 after my successful hit, Zombie. I love originality. I’m an example of art and this can tell through my image, look and sound. I can say this is the right time and the beginning of something great.  “The EP is the totality of my experiences and reality. I decided to put it out there to let the world feel how I felt. It’s both an adventure and the takeoff point. This project contains six tracks of 19 minutes duration. In my future works, I hope to collaborate with Davido. He does magic to sounds.”
