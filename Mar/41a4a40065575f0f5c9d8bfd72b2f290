The Labour Party (LP) governorship candidate in Abia State, Dr. Alex Otti, has declared the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state dead, boasting that it will be buried on March 11, 2023. He hinged his confidence about the victory of his party in the coming governorship election on the poor outing of the PDP in the Presidential and National Assembly elections held in the state.   Speaking at a reception organized in his honour by the CY Nwankwo Foundation ahead of the March 11 governorship election in Abia, Otti berated the PDP for launching evil propaganda against him. “They have gone ahead to reappoint some miscreants they had sacked earlier as local government Transition Committee chairmen. I think they’re just reacting like a man that is drowning. But they’re already drowned and we are going to bury them on the 11th of March,” he declared. Promising to redeem Abia State from the doldrums of underdevelopment, he said: “I want to develop this state. I want us to feel good as Abia people. I don’t want us to feel ashamed to introduce ourselves as coming from Abia, which is one of the reasons I came out to contest this election. “That is why I thought I should break an egg to make omelette for all our people. Breaking an egg in this case, for me, is giving up my illustrious job as bank chief executive to launch this fight and I have been consistent since I started it,” he said. He declared that he would do everything legally and morally possible to lead the fight to reclaim Abia from the stranglehold of the PDP. Otti, who was accompanied to the event by the newly elected member, Isialangwa South, and North Federal Constituency, Hon Ginger Onwusibe, and Isialangwa North State Constituency candidate, Hon Ambassador Innocent Uruakpa, thanked the founder and chairman board of trustees of the CY Nwankwo Foundation, Sir Cyprian Nwankwo for their endorsement and offer of support.
