From Godwin Tsa, Abuja The Presidential Election Petition Tribunal (PEPT) has turned down the request by the Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC), to vary its orders allowing Atiku Abubakar and Peter Obi to inspect election materials used for the February 25 presidential polls.  The tribunal in its ruling a short while ago, said the application was unnecessary because it never granted permission to Atiku, Obi and their parties to scientifically access and inspect INEC’s database which includes the BVAS devices. The three-member panel led by Justice Joseph Ikyegh dismissed the apprehension and concern being expressed by INEC, which includes the possible revelation of the identities of voters and their voting choices, as unnecessary because no applicant was granted leave to access INEC’s database. details later
