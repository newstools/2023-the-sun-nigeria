From Noah Ebije, Kaduna The People’s Democratic Party (PDP) in Kaduna State has said that it intends to seek an alliance with the Labour Party (LP) and other opposition parties in the state ahead of the governorship and House of Assembly elections to oust the governing All Progressive Congress (APC). Kaduna PDP Chairman Felix Hassan Hyet made this known at a press conference, adding that the people of Kaduna have had enough of the APC and have decided to vote for the PDP. The PDP, he said, was not ruling out an alliance with other parties especially the labour party so as to win Kaduna State. “We want to rescue the state and restore hope and the lost glory people have missed in the state,” he said. “The people have spoken by coming out en masse to vote for our party and our presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar. We appreciate the love shown to us. Honestly, we will not joke about it. “LIke in 2019, when our candidate got the highest votes, we repeated the same feat and gave him the highest votes in the just concluded presidential election held on the 25th of February 2023 in the state. “This is the first time the PDP won all three senatorial seats since the advent of democracy in 1999. “We won all the three senatorial seats and ten seats of the House of Representatives seats. We want to win more. He thanked the people of the state, the party leaders, elders as well as stakeholders for their doggedness in the last Saturday’s polls and urged them not to relent and ensure that the same feat is repeated during the gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections.
