From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Vice Presidential candidate, Ifeanyi Okowa and his Labour Party counterpart, Datti Baba-Ahmed have described the February 25 presidential poll as a sham, Okowa and Baba-Ahmed, who spoke  at a joint press briefing, on Tuesday, in Abuja, said they were in agreement with the position of their respective parties, calling for cancellation of the poll, over alleged irregularities. The PDP Vice presidential candidate, who read a prepared text at the press briefing, noted that the transmission of the election results, must be in line with the provision of the Electoral Act and the guidelines of the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC). According to him, “on Saturday, the 25th of February, 2023, Nigerians from the different parts of our great country braced all manner of challenges to cast their votes for their preferred candidates. And having cast their votes, they are expectantly awaiting the results of the presidential and National Assembly election. “ We wish to state for the records that last weekend’s election was a sham. It was neither free nor fair. What played out yesterday at the National Collation Center exposes the National Chairman of playing to a predetermined script. Our position remains that the election and transmission of the results must be in tandem with the Electoral Act and the INEC guidelines. “There is no doubt that INEC is under a statutory obligation to transmit election results electronically. Paragraph 38 of the INEC manual made pursuant to section 149 of the Electoral Act 2022 and the 1999 constitution as amended provides for this.
