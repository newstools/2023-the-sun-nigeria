Four young men allegedly behind ceaseless killings in parts of Ebonyi State have been burnt alive.  The four, according to our source, who listed their names, all hailed from Okputoimo and Ndufumota villages in Ikwo Local Government Area of the state.  It was gathered that they were caught last Friday night (eve of general election) with cutlasses and other dangerous weapons on their way to strike.  On interrogation by the village vigilante, it was discovered that they were behind the killings in some parts of the state: “A paper listing 25 names of those they wanted to kill that night was discovered on them. They had already killed four prominent people in the village before they were caught.”  One of the suspected criminals who who allegedly usually ferried the gangsters to operations with his motorcycle was tied to stake waiting to be set ablaze by the youths of the village, when we got the information.  The four young men were alleged to have killed a phone charger (names withheld) in the village, while another of their victims, identified simply as Daniel was also slain in his home at midnight.  Police authorities would not speak on the issue and the newly established security outfits in the state after the disbandment of the Ebubeagu Security Network, were yet to fully take off.
