From Molly Kilete, Abuja Crisis is brewing within the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), as some key members fight over the control of the groups bank account in Germany and the United States of America. It was gathered that following the arrest and detention of the IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, who is now in the custody of the Department of State Services (DSS), a faction loyal to Simon Ekpa, have refused to honor directives from the IPOB leader orders that has resulted to a split within the group. Apart from the disagreement between Kanu and Ekpa, it was also gathered that kanu’s family members are fighting youth and nail over who controls the groups finances in dollars and Euros totaling over €700,000, $500,000 in separate accounts. A top security source who does not want to be mentioned in print, said the power tussle between two of Kanu’s relations who are currently at loggerhead as to who should be in control of the dollar account and this is affecting the operations of the group. The source further stated that the Euro account being controlled by Simon Ekpa, has not been able to take full control of the account owe issues of signatories resulting to the German government putting the account on hold. A top security source who does not want to be mentioned in print, said “Kanu is really not happy with the fight for the financial control in his absence. “He is complaining that Ekpa is not taking orders from him in respect to the directives on the activities of the group. Imagine Kanu has giving directive on several occasions for the abolition of sit-at-home order but Ekpa keeps countering the order.” The source said “on the just concluded elections, Kanu was not happy that despite his directive for elections to hold in south -east with massive turn out of electorates, Epka issued a counter-directive, which almost affected the outcome of the election.”
