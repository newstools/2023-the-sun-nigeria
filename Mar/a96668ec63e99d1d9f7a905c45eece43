From Gyang Bere, Jos The Chairman of Global Coalition for Better and Brighter Nigeria (CBBN), Prophet Isa El-Buba, has accused the Independent National Election Commission (INEC) of committing electoral fraud against the presidential candidate of Labour Party, Peter Obi during the penultimate election. Prophet El-Buba, who disclosed this yesterday while addressing journalists in Jos, said Peter Obi was right to have claimed that he won the election but denied the much-expected victory because of the alleged manipulation of the election by INEC. El-Buba said his group was fully behind the position of Obi on the outcome of the presidential polls, noting that the Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu, had publicly assured Nigerians and the International community that the commission had made adequate preparation for a free and fair election. According to him, the outcome of the polls fell below the expectations of Nigerians. He maintained that the failure to transmit results had given room for manipulating the presidential results announced by Yakubu at the Collation Centre in Abuja. His words: “These manipulations were carried out under the watchful eyes and connivance of security agents at several polling units and INEC offices. “The decision of INEC to go ahead to announce these doctored results based on manufactured voting has defeated the efforts made by Nigerians to see that the Electoral Act was amended to allow for electronic transmission of results.” He called for a fresh conduct of the presidential polls in line with the provisions of the Electoral Act as amended.
