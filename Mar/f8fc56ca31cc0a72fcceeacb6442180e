From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi A pro-Biafra agitator, Emeka Emekesiri, Esq, has said that the statement on social media credited to Pa Ayo Adebanjo about the Presidency of Nigeria had said it all. He quoted Pa Adebanjo as allegedly saying that Nigerians had shown that they wanted Mr Peter Obi to be their President by voting for him. According to him, Pa Adebanjo allegedly declared that if the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) dared to rig the election, Nigerians should protest for the international community to intervene, adding that the elder statesman told the powers that be that if they did not want an Igbo man to rule Nigeria, then the Igbo should be allowed to go and have their Biafra. “Whether the statement was made by Pa Ayo Adebanjo or not, the truth is that the statement remains the truth. We are not begging INEC to do the right thing. “Peter Obi is not desperate to become the President of Nigeria. He is on a mission to salvage Nigeria. “The Igbo man can survive anywhere in the world. We have passed through fire, and it did not burn us, and through rivers and oceans and were not drowned. “We leave our homeland to invest in and develop other regions of Nigeria showing that we believe in Nigeria but we are rejected. “If Nigeria proves unsalvageable and irredeemable, we are not to blame. Onye a juru aju anaghi aju onwe ya (He that is rejected does not reject himself), ” he said. He noted that if they did not want Obi to rule Nigeria, they had rejected the Igbo in the final analysis and had no reason to stop them from ruling themselves as an independent nation by whatever name chosen to call themselves. “We may revive our old Republic of Biafra or answer a new name, REPUBLIC OF LOWER NIGER, to include our brothers from the Middle Belt and South-South regions who believe in fairness, equity and justice, ” he concluded.
