From George Onyejiuwa, Owerri  INEC’s Resident Electoral Commissioner for Imo State, Prof. Sylvia Agu, yesterday, said elections would hold in Orlu, Orsu and other troubled areas in the state this Saturday. Speaking during a stakeholders’ meeting to review last Saturday’s presidential and National Assembly elections in the state with a view to finding solutions to mistakes made, Agu expressed her desire to deploy both personnel and electoral materials to areas affected by insecurity in the state like Orlu, Orsu, Oru East. She pleaded with politicians to cooperate with the commission to make the polls a success. She blamed members of the National Union of Road Transport Workers(NURTW) and their NARTO counterparts for backing out from the agreement earlier signed with INEC at the last minute. She accused politicians for aiding the transport unions  in that action to rubbish the commission. Agu who pleaded with stakeholders to suggest ways to ensure hitch-free House of Assembly elections next Saturday, was advised by stakeholders to put private transporters in their plans to avoid last minute disappointment from established transport unions. The REC was counseled that if hired transporters were not at their duty posts by  8am on election day, the commission should start making alternative arrangements immediately.
