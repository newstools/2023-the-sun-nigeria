A non-governmental organisation (NGO), United Action Against Corruption, said the Chairman, Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC), AbdulRasheed Bawa, deserves support, cooperation and commendation in the discharge of his duties. Leader of the group, James Adeyemi, in a statement in Lagos, at the weekend, said the EFCC under Bawa has been doing a good job and deserves the full support of Nigerians, as a way of encouragement to do more. Adeyemi said Nigeria needed to be cleansed of graft, to allow the country to grow and develop properly. He said the huge amount of stolen public money the commission recovered under Bawa’s leadership was disturbing, describing the feat as amazing, impressive and commendable.  “That is part of the reasons we think the commission and its leadership deserve total support of the generality of Nigerians, if we truly desire a graft-free society, where our collective patrimony would not end in private pocket, but to be used for ventures that would benefit all and sundry,” the group said. It expressed the belief that all government agencies doing yeoman’s job like the EFCC, in the country, should be protected collectively by the citizens.
