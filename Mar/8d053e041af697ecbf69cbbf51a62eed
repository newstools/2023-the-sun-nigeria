Though electrified, the atmosphere was laced with glitz and glam as one of the leading worship leaders in Nigeria, Enkay Ogboruche dedicated her latest album titled, Declaration and also used the occasion to mark her 10th anniversary as a gospel music minister.  “I’m grateful to the Almighty God, who is my sustainer. The journey of 10 years as a gospel music minister has been highly tasking and demanding, but laced with God’s favour and grace. It can only be God,” she said. Born into a family of seven, Ogboruche whose birth name is Nkiruka Gift Onuabuobi, had her first experience in the studio using a bottle and spoon in a recording with her father. Enkay was a member of the defunct Tehila Crew before she started her own band. “I took off as a solo artiste with a debut album, Kingdom Anthem, a 10-track album that was distributed by Honesty Music, with a popular track, Yes, You Are The Lord,” she recalled. Her second album, The Bridge, was released in 2018 at the Enkay Live in Concert, which held at Eko Convention Center, Lagos with the likes of Kierra Sheard on the bill.  However, to crown her efforts in the gospel music arena, Enkay hit the shelves globally with Declaration, her latest work. A sneak preview of the album reveals a masterpiece that is set to redefine gospel music. The album features such artistes as Judikay and Nathaniel Bassey amongst others. Enkay, however, acknowledged the supportive role of her husband, Dr. Timothy Ogboruche for her musical success. “He is everything to me – a prayer partner, encourager, financier and my pastor. My prayer is for God to continue to keep and bless him for me and the family,” she stated.
