From David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi Labour Party chieftain Emeka Emekesiri, has described the February 25 presidential election an expression of unity and general acceptance of Mr. Peter Obi of the Labour Party by Nigerians. Mr Emekesiri said that the election had united all men and women of good conscience, godliness and purity who believe in righteousness, fairness, equity and justice. “I want to tell all my fellow Obi-dients fighting for our freedom and liberation under the Obi-Datti Movement that all things work together for good to them that love God, who are called according to his purpose. We have not lost the election. In fact, we have won. “Surely, our principal Peter Obi and his vice, Datti Ahmed, shall be sworn in to rule Nigeria.  We shall fight until we reclaim our victory. “INEC has set Nigeria on fire. We will not allow the rulers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in the high places of government who have kept us in bondage to continue to enslave us,” he said. He described judiciary as the last hope of the common man, adding that if it fails to uphold justice in this case, then the people should say: ‘To your tents O Israel.’ “We are not begging them to do the right thing,” he concluded.
