By Bimbola Oyesola The Nigeria Labour Congress (NLC) has said that the rehabilitation and operation of petroleum refineries in the country is being hindered by the alarming level of corruption in the system. The president of NLC, Joe Ajaero, speaking during a courtesy visit to the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) in Lagos, expressed disappointment at the government’s inability to repair the refineries in the time frame proposed. He alleged that there could be a connivance between contractors and some government officials to deliberately extend the time so as to request for more money. “We keep hearing about contracts for turnaround maintenance, at the end of the day, nothing is happening due to corruption in the system. I don’t see why contractors are asking for variation when they are not being owed for the contract. Variation in this sense is when the contractors are asking for additional money,” he said. NUPENG President, Williams Akporeha in his address highlighted the challenges the union is facing and requested for support from the NLC to find lasting solutions to them. Likewise, he lamented the delay in the rehabilitation of the refineries while questioning the sincerity of purpose of the government in the exercise.  He noted that that the slow pace of work in the refineries is threatening the jobs of the workers there and affecting the productivity and growth of the sector. According to him, “The Port Harcourt refinery in Rivers State supposed to commence operations this month by the initial plan, but now we don’t know what is happening.” “The inconsistency is giving us worry, not to talk of other rehabilitation projects that are yet to take off. The reason I bring this to your attention is that the jobs of most of our workers in those areas are being threatened, including those of contract workers,” he added.
