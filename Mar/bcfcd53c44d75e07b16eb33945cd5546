By Merit Ibe Export for survival will continue to be a cliche till we become more deliberate about positioning Nigeria’s small and medium Enterprises (SMEs) for the global market. Founder of Dasun Integrated Farms Ltd and DIFL Nigeria, Bosun Solarin, made the remark during the Talking Trade and Investment Global February webinar with the Theme: Creating a sustainable Non-Export-Driven-Economy: What Nigeria Must Do. Solarin noted that Nigeria cannot  continue to do things the same way and expect different results, adding that as a nation, we must act with sustainable strategies to realise a better Nigeria we hope for, one that is driven and flourishing based on non-oil export. Solarin, who has been actively exporting Nigeria products on  international scale, decried the structural defect pulling back many Nigerians small businesses. She also explained that  businesses that do not have a proper accounting system and record-keeping systems will be unable to receive support or grants to grow their businesses from reputable donor agencies. She recommended the creation of an export civil society sector group that will help fight policies that do not support exporters and resolve a situation where exporters  are tossed to and fro. “Until we put our differences behind us, mend, change our ways, allow integrity, trust, accountability, credibility and through a most determined effort, build a team that is formidable enough to withstand detractors, when our advocacy becomes stronger, then we will begin to move closer to our destination.” “Business membership organisations must play an advocacy role in capacity building, business growth, trade facilitation and funding opportunities for businesses insetting up with standards for successful trading.” She said efficiencies will come from proactively transforming how  business is done, saying collaboration is the new competition.”
