The attention of the Management of The Sun Publishing Ltd (Publishers of Daily Sun, Saturday Sun, Sunday Sun,  and Sporting Sun newspapers as well as the online version – sunnewsonline.com) has been drawn to a certain online publication using a fake and cloned brand logo of our online platform.  For the avoidance of doubt,  and to set the record straight, the online publication of 3rd February 2023 which contains the picture of one Ramon Sunday Adeniye and some criminal indictments against him was not published by our Company.  We urge and advise our teeming readers, advertisers and the public to be wary of the said fake publication bearing a cloned and fake brand logo of our Company.  Take Notice that we shall not be held liable for any form of liability arising therein. Meanwhile,  we are not taking this infraction lightly as necessary steps are being taken in collaboration with law enforcement agencies to unmask the criminal elements behind it to ensure that justice is served. For the avoidance of doubt, our online readers are advised to visit “sunnewsonline.com” to access our content. -Editor
