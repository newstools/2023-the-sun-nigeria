By Brown Chimezie Following the Supreme Court ruling that the old 200, 500 and 1000 remain legal tender alongside the new  currencies until 31st December this year, the Eze Ndigbo Ifako Ijaye, Eze Michael Ezekwobi (Oyiomanatumba Ndigbo Gbaagburugburu). has called on the Central Bank of Nigeria to address Nigerians on its compliance with the apex court’s rulling. In a statement, the Royal father said such clarification will douse the confusion in the financial sector and end the economic hardship faced by Nigerians  who are daily finding it difficult to access their money from banks. While commending the judiciary for rising to the occasion, Ezekwobi also appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari, to also address Nigerians on this crucial matter. “Today, despite the supreme court judgement, people are still rejecting the old 500 and one thousand Naira note because the Federal Government and CBN Governor has refused to confirm if they have complied with the court judgement.  While the deadlock lasts, it is the common man that suffers.”, he said. On the Saturday March 11 election, Ezekwobi called on electorate to exercise their franchise peacefully by voting the candidate of their choice.
