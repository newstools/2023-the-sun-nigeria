Determined to offset the backlog of pensions and gratuities arrears in Ogun State, Governor Dapo Abiodun has announced the increment of the quarterly payment of pension to N1 billion. Abiodun made this known while addressing pensioners during an interactive session at the June 12 Cultural Centre, Kuto, Abeokuta, yesterday. The governor said his administration met an arrears of over N80 billion and had since developed ways of defraying it. “When we came in, we met pension arrears of over N80 billion. We started paying N500 million at a time. We later increased it to N600 million monthly. If the previous government had been paying, we would not be where we are today. “I am expecting about N280 billion from the Federal Government being the money we spent constructing federal roads. I can assure you as soon as I get that money, I will pay between N10 and N18 billion as pensions and gratuities,” the governor said. Abiodun, who disclosed no gratuity was paid from 2012 up to when he assumed office in 2019, however, announced increment of N15,000 for pensioners who were previously collecting N5,000 monthly pension, wondering how people would survive with such paltry amount of money at the present difficult time. Earlier, Chairman, Nigeria Union of Pensioners, Waheed Oloyede, urged the state government to increase the monthly pension of those still collecting N5,000, just as the N600 million quarterly payment for pension was inadequate to pay gratuities. While calling for the review of pensions in the state in line with what is obtainable at the federal level, Oloyede called for a regular interface between the pensioners and the state government to enable them solve any impending issues. Also, Chairman, Local Government Pensioners Association, Benedict Ademoye, appreciated the governor for giving due attention to issues relating to pensioners, assuring him of their support at all times.
