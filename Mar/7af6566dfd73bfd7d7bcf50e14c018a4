Tuesday 21 February was a red letter day for the family and friends of United Kingdom-based business mogul and philanthropist, Prince Olusoga Elias Adeyemi Olowolekomoh as he buried his mother, Alhaja Falilat Titilayo Ebun Alake Olowolekomoh in a grand style. Alhaja Olowolekomoh passed away at the age of 75, on February 13 and was buried the next day, February 14, according to Islamic rites at her Ikorodu, Lagos residence. The eighth-day Fidua prayers and reception held at the Soga Lekomoh International Event Centre, in Majidun, Ikorodu, Lagos, became a carnival of sort as Olowolekomoh, the Oba-elect of Odo Nla kingdom —a community in Ikorodu division of Lagos— turned a perfect host to hundreds of the crème de la crème of Lagos social establishment including the royal entourages of Ayangburen of Ikorodu, the Fidipote Ruling House (Idewon Quarters) of Ijebu Ode, Ogun State and Olootu Oba Meta, Chief Ekiyoyo. The expansive event centre at a point could not contain the surging crowd but the combined team of security operatives comprising the Nigerian Army, Police, Civil Defence corps personnel, as well as a private security outfit ensured that all went well without a hitch. In his appreciation message, Oba-elect Olowolekomoh thanked all who took time out to grace the occasion.
