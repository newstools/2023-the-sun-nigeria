From Adanna Nnamani, Abuja The Labour Party (LP) says it has not instructed any of its chapters to liaise or support any candidate other than its own in the upcoming Saturday’s Governorship and State House of Assembly LP National Chairman, Julius Abure, stated this in a statement on Tuesday in Abuja.  He encouraged all who believe in the LP presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi and the philosophy of the party not to be deterred, but troop out en masse and vote for all LP candidates anywhere in the country. He said: “As preparation for this Saturday’s Governorship/State House of Assembly elections enter final preparations, the Labour Party is leaving nothing to chance in ensuring that our candidates not only participate, but win at the ballot. “This call becomes necessary given reports from some political opportunists from other political platforms, claiming that they have reached an agreement with Obidients and LP supporters to cast their ballots for them in this Saturday’s polls. “We want to state categorically and unequivocally that the national secretariat of LP has not given any instructions for any chapter of the party to liaise or support any candidate except LP candidates in this Saturday’s polls. “Our members should not only go out and vote, but follow the process to a conclusive end as provided by the Law. “We encourage millions of the electorate who believe in LP presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi and the philosophy of the party not to be deterred, but troop out en masse and vote for all LP candidates anywhere in the country. The LP is not in any alliance with any political party in the run-up to this Saturday’s polls.”
