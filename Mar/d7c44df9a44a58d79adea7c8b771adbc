Beautiful plus-size actress-cum-social media influencer, Mary John, has opened up on why she would want to go under the knife. The POS star actress in an interview with Saturday Sun said: “Yes, I have plans to go under the knife to remove my belly fats. I don’t want any addition to my butts or breasts; they are perfect. I just want to work on the size of my stomach. As a plus size, I think that is my major challenge; I can’t speak for anyone else because people face their own challenges differently. I carry myself with so much pride. I am me and I will never want to be anyone else.”  Asked what her unique selling points are, the Bayelsa State indigene said it’s her eyes and voice. “For me, my eyes are my special selling points, but people will say ‘Mary is a liar, it’s her bum bum’. But I’ll always choose my lovely eyes and beautiful voice any time. They always stand me out,” she asserted. Mary John also revealed her turn on and off in a relationship, stating that a respectful and understanding man gives her the kick. “My turn on will be a responsible, caring and God fearing man who allows his woman to be herself at all time. A man who understands the ‘word’ respect. My turn off will be an uptight man who thinks he owns the world. A man who does not understand that a woman too can be busy with work. Some men are so insecure that when she doesn’t take his calls, he would quickly assume that his woman is with another man. That’s a big turn off. I can’t deal with a jealous man.”
