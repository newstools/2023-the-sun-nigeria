A dramatic case of mistaken identity has left a Chinese family in complete shock. In 2014, Zhuo Kangluo was confirmed dead following a car accident. Both family and friends had identified a body at the side of a roadside as being him. Following the accident, Zhuo’s nephew decided to have the body cremated without an autopsy. But the surprise appearance of a man acting ‘strangely’ in a village nine years later led to a mind-blowing revelation.  His behaviour had captured the attention of Chongqing authorities in August, according to the China News Network. A DNA test proved he was Zhuo, despite it being years after his assumed ‘death’. His grandson was also able to identify him when taken to the village. The man reportedly burst into tears and wrote the names of those related to him when visited by his grandson. Authorities in China are now working to identify the man who was mistakenly thought to be Zhuo in 2014.
