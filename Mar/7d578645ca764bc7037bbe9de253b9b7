By Christy Anyanwu The Synagogue Church of All Nations (SCOAN) has opened its first branch in Ondo State, the home state of its founder, the late Prophet TB Joshua. The multimillion naira edifice is sited in Akure, the Ondo State capital, along Ilesha-Owo Express Way, opposite NNPC Mega Station. The sprawling structure sits on more than five hectares of land and is capable of accommodating over 6,000 worshippers. Ondo State Governor, Arakunrin Rotimi Akeredolu (SAN), who was represented by his deputy, Lucky Ayedatiwa, during the commissioning ceremony, described the new SCOAN branch as a giant stride under the leadership of Pastor Evelyn Joshua.  “This is a monumental project with tremendous grace for the uplifting of the people of Ondo State in who will benefit from more of God’s blessings. With this environment, they won’t have to travel to Lagos again for worship because the spirit of God is one and is here,” he said.  He commended the vision of the SCOAN and congratulated its leadership under Pastor Mrs. Joshua for her perseverance in holding forth and reinforcing the legacy of the founder and keeping the saints together after the passing of Prophet TB Joshua. He also commended the church members all over the world for their laudable efforts and commitment that made it possible to open the first branch in Nigeria in Ondo State.
