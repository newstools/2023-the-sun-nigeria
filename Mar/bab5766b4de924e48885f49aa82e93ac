From Paul Osuyi, Asaba Delta State governorship candidate of All Progressive Grand Alliance (APGA), Great Ogboru has promised to liberate the state from captivity if elected on Saturday. Ogboru made this promise when his campaign train stopped at the headquarters of God’s Grace Ministry Church, Arubaye, Warri, for the church’s General Women’s Week with the theme: ‘Jesus Calms the Storm’. He said if elected, his administration would run an all inclusive government with better future for the state. Besides, Ogboru promised Deltans a new state that will offer better life which the people have been yearning for for over two decades now. He said a vote for all APGA candidates will be the beginning of transformation of Delta State. “The spirit of the Lord is upon me, and he has anointed me to preach the good news to the poor, he has sent me to heal the broken hearted and asked me to set the captives free. “The message of today is the message of hope, because all we have gone through in the hands of bad government will come to an end come March 11. “And that is why I am here that Deltans will have life and have it more abundantly,” he declared. The APGA Jubilee agenda campaign train also moved to the nooks and cranny of Patani Local Government Area to give the message to the people ahead of the Saturday’s election. Ogboru reassured Patani residents and indigenes that the Jubilee agenda for Deltans include health, education, agriculture, empowerment of youth, food security, human capital development and infrastructural development, environment, investment in the comparative areas and equal opportunity development which will give equal opportunities to local government areas to develop their local government. He noted that APGA Jubilee agenda represents all that Deltans needed to be liberated from captivity and implored voters to come out massively on Saturday to vote him into office alongside all APGA House of Assembly candidates.
