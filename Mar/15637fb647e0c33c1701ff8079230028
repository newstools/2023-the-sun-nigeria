By Vincent Kalu The Abia State Coordinator of the Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, Chief Umeh Kalu, SAN, has congratulated the Abia electorate on voting massively for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, last Saturday and urged them to repeat the same feat at this Saturday’s governorship election by electing Dr Alex Otti, the candidate of LP. In a statement made available to Daily Sun, Chief Kalu told Abia people not to be dispirited by the outcome of the presidential election, which he noted was a disappointment to most Nigerians, and has also received knocks and condemnation from the international community. According to him, “no election in the history of Nigeria has ever attracted so much interest and concern to the Nigerian public, including Nigerians in the diaspora like the 2023 general elections. “The enormous and unprecedented interest that this election generated cannot be separated from the dire and pathetic situation in which Nigerians have found themselves in recent times. “For all of us, who are citizens of Abia and other residents, including those carrying on their businesses in the state, February 25, 2023, was a defining moment, which they had yearned for long. “The pattern of voting was not only an indication that Abians have joined other well–meaning Nigerians in checkmating the speedy decline in the socio–economic situation of Nigeria but equally showed their courage and determination to liberate themselves from the suffocating stranglehold of a cartel that has held them down for more than a decade. Moving forward, Chief Kalu enjoined all Abians to troop out en masse this Saturday, to consolidate the gains of February 25, 2023. The consolidation of the gains, he said, “lies only in voting massively for Dr. Alex Otti and all Labour Party candidates.”
