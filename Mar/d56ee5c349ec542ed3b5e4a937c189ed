Describing the making of the song, Libianca notes: “I was going through a lot during Thanksgiving week and felt so unseen – nobody noticed what was going on. I remembered thinking, I have to stay consistent with my content on social media, so I can’t afford to sit around in my emotions right now. So, I walked past my room to the studio, found a beat and recorded it.” Growing up between Cameroon and Minnesota, Libianca blends the sounds of her childhood, to create her own Afropop leaning sound that is heard across her music.
