Kylian Mbappe exchanged his shirt with Ignatius Ganago after the Nantes striker’s daughter passed away two weeks ago. Mbappe broke Paris Saint-Germain’s goalscoring record by netting his 201st goal for the club in the 4-2 victory over Nantes, for whom Ganago was on target. Ganago’s daughter Chloe tragically passed away last month aged five following an illness. Following the sad news last month, Nantes wrote on Twitter: ‘FC Nantes is in mourning. It is with deep sadness that the Football Club of Nantes has learned of the death of our striker’s daughter, Ignatius Ganago. ‘We think a lot of you, Gana. The Club is with you through this terrible ordeal.’ After the game at the Parc des Princes Mbappe went up to Ganago in the tunnel and gave him his record-breaking shirt, as reported by Espoirs De Foot. There was a warm hug between the duo as they swapped shirts in front of onlookers in the tunnel. Lionel Messi had opened the scoring in the 12th minute, with an own goal from Jaouen Hadjam adding to PSG’s lead. Nantes responded through Ludovic Blas and Ganago to bring the game level. Danilo Pereira then restored PSG’s advantage before Mbappe netted his historic goal late on. A Cameroon international, Ganago has been at Nantes since September 2022, when he joined from Lens.  Mbappe, 24, overtook Edinson Cavani as PSG’s all-time record goalscorer in just his 247th appearance for the club. He initially joined PSG on loan from Monaco in 2017 before making the move permanent the following year.
