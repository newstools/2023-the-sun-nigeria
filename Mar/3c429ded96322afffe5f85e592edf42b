From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja The National Coalition for Unity and Peace has said there is need for the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to explain the lapses observed in the February 25 presidential poll, as demanded by Nigerians. The coalition also stated that it was imperative for INEC to tell Nigerians the measure taken to avoid a repeat of the situation in the March 11 gubernatorial and state houses of assembly election. These were contained in a communiqué issued by the coalition, which is chaired by former Senate President, Ken Nnamani, after a meeting in Abuja, to review the state of the nation, in the aftermath of last weekend’s presidential poll. The communiqué, which was signed by the protem Secretary General of the group, Cairo Ojuogboh, equally condemned the resort to violence by state some persons, leading to deaths, in the aftermath of the election. Consequently, it called for investigations into the incidents, so as to bring the masterminds to book.  Furthermore, the coalition congratulated the President-elect, Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, and the Vice President-elect, Senator Kashim Shettima, on their victor, and commended former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar; Peter Obi, Rabiu Kwankwaso, presidential candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party and New Nigerian Peoples Party (NNPP) for their courageous and impressive performance at the poll. The communiqué added that the coalition observed “that the Presidential, National Assembly Elections were generally held peacefully in most parts of the country on 25th February 2023.  “The meeting notes the efforts of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for improvement in the electoral process, which ensured peaceful outcomes. However, NCU joins millions of Nigerians to express serious concerns that INEC was unable to deliver on its promises to deploy the best of technology, including electronic transmission of results.”
