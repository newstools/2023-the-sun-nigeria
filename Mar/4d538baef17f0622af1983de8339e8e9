From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha A coalition of the All Progressives Congress (APC) support groups, the APC National Patriots Platform, has appealed to the leadership of the party and the senators-elect to elect the most ranking senator from the South East, Senate Chief Whip and senator representing Abia North senatorial zone, Orji Uzor Kalu, to succeed Ahmed Lawan as president in the 10th Assembly. Coordinator of the group, Musa Uba, in a statement, said with the victory of Bola Tinubu and Kashim Shettima, from the South West and North East respectively, it is equitable for the leadership of the party to zone the Senate presidency to the South East. The group, which consists of APC members who worked tirelessly for the victory of the party in the presidential polls stated that the nation would need a dynamic, visionary, stable and purposeful National Assembly that will complement Tinubu’s plans to deliver on the Renewed Hope Mandate. Uba said Kalu is the ideal Senate president Nigeria needs, noting that he  has nationalist vision with legislative capacity and competence and an unalloyed commitment to APC. He stated that they have x-rayed candidates who have eyes on the Senate president’s seat and were bold to declare that Kalu is the ‘primus inter pares’ among his peers in the areas of legislative experience and expertise having sponsored over 25 bills that address the needs of the nation, moved motions for the security and peace of Nigeria. “He has shown loyalty, consistency, capacity, character and competence, we, therefore, strongly appeal to the leadership of APC and the senators-elect to consider the need for a stable leadership of the National Assembly which will not be in  variance with the vision of Tinubu, led government in delivering the democratic dividends to Nigerians who believe in the promise of hope and voted overwhelmingly for the APC.” The APC support group maintained that Kalu’s consistency in his support to the party and his acceptability across the six geo-political zones points to character and dependability which are critical to the person who will occupy the office of Senate president. The group further appealed to the leadership of the ruling party to zone the position to South East on the basis of equity, fairness, unity, justice and stability of the peace of the nation.
