By Brown Chimezie Council of Ndi Eze, Lagos State chapter has condemned the threats, intimidation and harassment of non-indigenes ahead of Saturday’s governorship election. This is as it called on Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to quickly intervene and restore orderliness in the state In a statement by Eze JI Nwoche, after a meeting by the council of Ndi Eze at Eze Omego’s palace, the council flayed the unlawful destruction of the Igbo property by unscrupulous persons and intimidating them to vote a particular party. “This is unconstitutional, unlawful, and anti-nationalistic. These bands of law breakers have constituted themselves as agents to disrupt peace and rules of law by attempting to create chaotic political atmosphere. We, therefore, request through the office of the Lagos State governor that these unscrupulous persons desist henceforth from such activities for the remaining phase of the election particularly the gubernatorial election on Saturday.”  The group said it had reported cases of intimidation of the Igbo to security agents in the state. It implored the Lagos State governor to wade into the mater, ameliorate the abuses  and assure Igbo of the their safety.  “To pacify affected Igbo business men and women who were hindered from going about their entrepreneurial activities, we hereby request that compensation for loss of properties be made for them.” The group said the Igbo community in Lagos was  interested in fostering the political ambition of any Lagos State governor given its grassroots follower-ship in the state in all the local government councils.
