From Lateef Dada, Osogbo The Labour Party has alleged that its supporters were threatened during the February 25 general elections in Osun State. The party charged all ‘Obidients’ to rise again and vote for candidates of the party in the House of Assembly election coming on March 11. The party also accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of denying its party agents tags thus affecting its performance in the state. The Coordinator of the Southwest Zone of the Big Tent Campaign Organization of the Labour Party, Lanre Fadahunsi, stated this at a press conference in Osogbo, at the weekend. He alleged that tags were not issued to some of the party agents whose names were submitted to the commission and people could not identify the party during the election. The party also lambasted INEC for its failure to fulfill its promise to upload results from the polling units, saying the deliberate decision not to upload results as promised compromised the sanctity of the process. “In Osun State, for instance, the non-issuance of the agent tags to the Labour Party agents made it impossible for our agents to be recognized officially even though the one thousand plus agents uploaded for Labour Party are a far cry from the over 3,000 uploaded to the INEC server. “The idea of ethnic profiling which characterized the electoral process in Lagos and some other parts of the Southwest should be condemned in all its ramifications,” he said.  The spokesperson of the party in Osun, Segun Babalola, condemned alleged violence in some parts of the state, alleging that voters were chased away by hoodlums. He warned against a repeat of such an attack in the coming election, saying that people must be allowed to vote for the candidate of their choice.
