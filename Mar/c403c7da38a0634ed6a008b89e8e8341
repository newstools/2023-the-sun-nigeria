Chairman of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Lagos State chapter, Philip Olabode Aivoji, has said with the competence, capacity and vision of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, and other candidates for the governorship, senatorial, House of Representatives and House of Assembly elections, the party is strategically favoured to win the general election.  Aivoji, who made the remarks during the party’s general assembly at its Ikeja state secretariat, said all the party’s candidates were not only ready to carry out the mandate of the people when elected, but were also interested in actualising the party’s resolve to restore and rebuild the country.  He said the party was prepared to leverage on the President Muhammed Buhari-led All Progressives Congress (APC) government’s maladministration of induced poverty, general state of insecurity, monumental level of corruption, deplorable level of infrastructure, rising unemployment and a collapsed economy to win the elections. The Lagos PDP chairman said the party was going into the elections with a history of performance and legacy achievements, stressing that during the PDP’s 16 years in power, the party not only gave Nigerians good governance, but also strengthened democratic institutions in order to add value to the people in an unprecedented move. Aivoji further added that the PDP made the country the fastest growing economy in Africa and the biggest economy on the continent during its 16 years in power. He enjoined the party members to join hands and win the various elections to rescue the country from the APC government’s bad leadership The PDP chieftain used the occasion to commend the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for putting in place necessary measures to ensure the success of the polls, but, however, reiterated the party’s strong objection to Lagos State INEC’s desire to engage the services of a core loyalist of the APC, Musiliu Akinsaya’s Lagos State Parks and Garages Management Committee for the distribution of election materials and personnel across the state as this would compromise the integrity of the elections.  “The Lagos State INEC must preserve the sanctity of the elections and ensure there is no room for any form of electoral malpractices as we wish to note that Akinsanya (a.k.a Oluomo) remained a member of APC Presidential Campaign Council and had held solidarity rallies for the party and its presidential candidate, which ultimately disqualified his organisation from handling such sensitive assignment.” Speaking at the event, a former minister of cooperation and integration in Africa, Bimbola Ogunkelu, described Atiku as a tested leader and appealed to the people to cast their votes for him and all other PDP candidates, stressing that the future of the country under Atiku would witness a greater level of development in all areas of life with the implementation of his Five-Point agenda, which would impact in an unprecedented manner on the life of the people. The former minister stressed that the last eight years of the APC administration had been abysmal failure and assured Nigerians that the incoming PDP administration would give purposeful leadership and return the country on the path of glory. In his own remarks, a former state chairman of the party, Tunji Shelle, he counselled the party members and the electorate in general to ensure they troop out en masse on the election days and cast their votes for the PDP, adding that they must, however, refuse to be intimidated by members of APC. Highlights of the event that drew thousands of party members from the 20 local government areas of the state were the pledge of solidarity supports to the party and presentation of PDP flag to members of the Lagos State chapter of the National Union of Road Transport Workers (NURTW) by Aivoji, official identification and offer of supports by the entire members of the Lagos State Arewa Women Forum, the National Youths and Students Movement and the Youths Grassroot Movement.
