Former Chairman of Ohanaeze Ndigbo in Anambra, Chris Eluemunoh, has praised the South East people over their active participation in the February 25 general elections. Eluemunoh said the electorate have demonstrated greater interest and commitment in political activities of the country. He said he commended the electorate in the South East for their bravery to take active political participation despite the threat from gunmen that elections will not hold in the region. “I was particularly keen to see what the electorate in the zone will do during the elections proper, I am excited over the turnout of the people. “I am proud of all the electorate who participated in the elections as they have proved that non-state actors cannot make decisions for them,” he said. Eluemunoh said all candidates elected in various capacities under different political parties deserved their win and urged them not to disappoint the trust reposed in them. He reminded the newly-elected candidates that a huge sacrifice was made by the people and advised that their efforts should not be taken for granted. “Our people have unanimously demonstrated sound and strong political will and willingness to elect their choice representatives,” he said. Eluemunoh said Nigerians have displayed their political maturity and congratulated Peter Obi for his positive outing. He called for peaceful resolutions of any political grievances and suggested that electoral law, as amended 2022 Act be used to resolve any discrepancies. Eluemunoh advised that anything that will promote peace, unity and progress of the country should be pursued in all transparency and honesty. “No single individual’s interest would be allowed to override the peaceful co-existence Nigerians are seriously yearning for,” he said.
