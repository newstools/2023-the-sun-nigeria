From Okwe Obi, Abuja The New Nigeria People’s Party (NNPP) has ruled out an alliance with the All Progressives Congress (APC), People’s Democratic Party (PDP) and the Labour Party in Saturday’s governorship and state Houses of Assembly polls. To this end, the party charged its members to stay focused, campaign vigorously and ensure the party sweeps the March 11, 2023 governorship and States House of Assembly elections across the country. NNPP National Publicity Secretary Major Agbo, said in a statement: “Our great party is not in any alliance with any political party in these elections. “Accordingly, party officers, members and candidates at all levels are not authorized to discuss, negotiate or form any alliance with any political party for the purpose of winning the upcoming gubernatorial and legislative polls. “Anyone who endorses a candidate of another political party will be sanctioned in line with the NNPP Constitution ranging from suspension from office, suspension from the party and possibly expulsion. “NNPP was registered by INEC in 2002 and has been expanding its frontiers in the nation’s political space in each electoral circle. “The party performed far more than the number four position INEC might have allotted to it in the controversial 2023 presidential election. “The party calls on the electoral umpire to sit up and redeem its self-inflicted injury that marred the presidential election by conducting free, fair, credible, transparent, acceptable, inclusive and peaceful governorship and States House of Assembly elections on March 11 2023. “NNPP urges Nigerians to turn up en masse and vote for all our party candidates for a new, better, greater and prosperous Nigeria we all desire and deserve.”
