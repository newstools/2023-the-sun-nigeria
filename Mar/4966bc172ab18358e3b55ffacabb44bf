From Abel Leonard, Lafia In a surprise move, the Labour Party (LP) gubernatorial candidate in Nasarawa State, Joseph Ewuga, has announced his decision to step down from the race and throw his weight behind the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) candidate, David Ombugadu.  Ewuga made the announcement at a press briefing on Wednesday, citing the need to rebuild Nasarawa State and a belief in the desire for change among the people. According to Ewuga, he had consulted with his supporters, party leaders and stakeholders across the state before arriving at the decision to join forces with the PDP. He expressed his confidence in Ombugadu’s ability to lead Nasarawa State to greater heights and promised to work tirelessly to ensure his victory in the forthcoming election. The LP candidate emphasized that his decision was borne out of a desire to put the interest of the people above personal ambition and political considerations. He urged his supporters to follow his lead and join hands with the PDP to bring about the change that Nasarawa State desperately needs. On his part, Ombugadu expressed his gratitude to Ewuga for his decision to step down and pledged to work closely with him to deliver on their shared vision for the state. He also called on other opposition candidates to join hands with him and his party to form a formidable alliance that will defeat the incumbent All Progressives Congress (APC) government in the state. The development is seen as a significant boost for the PDP, which has been struggling to gain a foothold in Nasarawa State. With Ewuga’s decision to join forces with Ombugadu, the PDP’s chances of winning the governorship election in the state have been greatly enhanced.
