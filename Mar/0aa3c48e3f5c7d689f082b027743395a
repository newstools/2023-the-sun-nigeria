From Okwe Obi, Abuja National President, Coalition of Civil Society Organizations on Gender Equality, Leadership, and Good Governance, Amb. Elizabeth Oziri, has charged the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to do better in future exercise. While addressing journalists yesterday in Abuja, she said the irregularities observed in the Presidential and National Assembly elections should not be allowed to repeat because of the image of the country. Oziri, who doubles as Executive Chairperson of Women and Child Disaster Rescue Initiatives, said: “We want to say that the electoral process was a bit okay in some of the states. But then some of the domestic and international observers noticed that a few situations in some polling units in some local governments did not go well. We hope that it would be better when next we try.” She, however, encouraged Nigerians, especially the youths to embrace peace because Nigeria is the only country we have.
