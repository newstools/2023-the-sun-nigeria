Sunday’s fire at the Maiduguri Monday Market destroyed 13,000 shops, Governor Babagana Zulum of Borno State said yesterday in Maiduguri. Zulum told visiting President Muhammadu Buhari that the fire ruined the livelihoods of, at least, 20,000 traders. He told the president that the North East Development Commission (NEDC), through the Federal Ministry of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, had provided support for the victims. “In addition to this, the Borno government also provided immediate humanitarian support of N1 billion to mitigate the sufferings of the victims,’’ Zulum said. He expressed the appreciation of the government and people of Borno for the president’s visit over the incident and said the people were looking forward to his support. Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Disaster Management and Social Development, Hajiya Sadiya Farouq, said support was provided through the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) and the NEDC. “They worked hand-in-hand with the Borno government to recover some goods, but, unfortunately, there was nothing to recover. Assessment is still ongoing. We have provided 30,000 bags of rice, 30,000 bags of maize and condiments, among others, as immediate succour. I have directed that the assessment should continue and we shall provide more support with building materials,’’ Farouq said. The minister assured that a report on the assessment would be submitted to the president’s office for consideration. The president, who also paid homage to the Shehu of Borno, Alhaji Abubakar Umar-Garbai El-Kanemi, expressed grief at the disaster.
