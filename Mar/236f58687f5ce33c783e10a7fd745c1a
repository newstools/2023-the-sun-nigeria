He urged Tinubu to make Nigeria better for all, irrespective of political parties, religion or ethnic nationalities. He said the mandate given to Tinubu was to get the people out of the present hardship, including rising insecurity, poverty and economic deficits. “Now that he has achieved his dream of becoming the president, Asiwaju should build bridges across all institutions – traditional, religious and political. “Asiwaju should always remember his social contract with the Nigerian youths. There is need for peace in the land and Nigeria must be restructured based on regionalism to ensure peace, unity, justice and fair-play. The betterment of all Nigerians must be his priority, and young Nigerians should be included in his administration,” he said.
