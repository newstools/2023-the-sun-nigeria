From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Chairman, House of Representatives Committee on Appropriation, Aliyu Muktar Betara, has been re-elected for the fifth time to represent Biu, Bayo, Kwaya Kusar and Shani Federal Constituency of Borno State. According to the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC), Betara, who was the candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), polled a total of 71,427 votes to defeat his closest rival Mohammed Ibrahim Biu of the People Democratic Party (PDP) who polled 15, 514. The lawmaker, in a statement, expressed profound gratitude to his constituents for renewing his mandate. He reaffirmed his commitment to giving quality representation to the constituency. Betara, who was considered a front-runner for the Speakership in the 10th Assembly, also expressed his appreciation to the leaders of the APC for their continued support over the years. He said “I want to particularly express my heartfelt gratitude to almighty Allah for making this day possible. This is a journey that commenced some months ago when they pulled together their hard-earned money to get the nomination forms for me and today they have marched that commitment with further action by voting overwhelmingly for me to emerge once again. “As you can see, there’s no excuse or reason to let my people down when I return back to Abuja because today they kept their promise of returning me and in turn fulfilling my own end of the social contract we have entered into. “I will continue to do my best to represent their interest and put them first in my legislative decisions and activities in the next four years inshallah. “I also want to thank the leadership of our great party the APC for the continuous support and encouragement over the years. I pray for total victory both in the presidential and governorship elections so that together we can provide the quality leadership that Nigerian deserve”.
