….says terrorists deployed ladies ahead of attack in Gwoza From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri  National Assembly member, Sen Mohammed Ndume has revealed how military troops halted an hour of Boko Haram attack on voters in Borno restive town during voting last Saturday. Ndume representing Borno South in the Senate, who witnesses the attack, said the terrorists targeted three voting locations in Gwoza, a town in the southeastern part of Borno as the February 25 elections was underway.  “On the election day, they were firing from the rear in the hill. They targeted three locations; INEC office, Gwoza Primary School and Jajeri. They first sent some ladies  as elections were starting,” he disclosed in an interaction with journalists on Wednesday in Maiduguri. Giving further details, the senator who was seeking re-election, said the military troops in the town fought the terrorists for nearly an hour before sanity returned and biting continued.  “The commander assured us they will clear the Boko Haram within 30 minutes or more and I was impressed by their gallantry. They fought and it didn’t take them more than an hour to restore normalcy,” he explained.  He also commended the deployment of technology by the military in monitoring the locations of the terrorists which he said, gave the forces greater advantage to hit at Boko Haram fighters.  The attack, according to the senator, scared many electorates and prevented then from voting.  He however commended the INEC officials and the people for their resilience.  Gwoza, the hometown of the senator has a total of 137,000 registered voters but only about 20,000 people voted last Saturday according to the results tally by INEC. At least five people were injured in the attack on the town by Boko Haram.
