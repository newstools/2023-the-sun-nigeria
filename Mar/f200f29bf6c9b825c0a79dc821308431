…As he unveils agenda The governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Enugu State, Chijioke Edeoga, has promised to restore the social, cultural and economic fortunes of the state if elected the governor. Edeoga, who spoke shortly after his appearance on two radio programmes broadcast on Solid FM and Family Love FM, said his mission was to heal the state from years of disunity and social and economic regression. He, therefore, urged the people to cast their votes for him, saying, “I am in the best position to heal the state of the imaginary divisions orchestrated by people whose only intention is political profits.” “It is unfortunate that a number of people have been laying emphasis on what divides us, rather than the multitudinous factors that prove we are one people. But I have dedicated my life to making our state better. People are working hard to draw imaginary lines of division between and among us, but I am here to blight those lines,” he said. This is even as he promised to address the challenges of water, an unfriendly business environment, multiple taxations, revenue leakages, and employment generation for the teeming youths.    To frontally deal with the problem of water, Edeoga explained that his approach would be the decentralization of water supply to remove the focus on the exclusive reliance on the Ajali Water Scheme for public water supply to the capital. In doing this, he said he will explore the disparate rivers, lakes, and water bodies in different parts of the capital to ensure that each area is supplied with clean water. He also pledged to enhance the earnings of public servants in the state by reducing the cost of governance, blocking revenue leakages, and making sure that the savings are transferred to workers in terms of higher monthly take-home.
