From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja  President Muhammadu Buhari has called on leaders of the various Chadian political factions to show restraint and patriotism by immersing themselves in the ongoing transition to democracy in their country. The president made the call, in a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity, Garba Shehu, while interacting with the country’s transition President and Head of Government, Mehmet Idris Deby-Itno, when he visited him on the sidelines of the ongoing UN programme in Doha, Qatar, yesterday. President Buhari said: “I watch developments in your country from a safe distance. As a close neighbour, I go to sleep and wake up with the issue on my mind. “I sympathise with you, not only as a youth, but due to the position of some of the groups operating outside the country, including Libya, even though this is a problem you inherited from your father. I am really reduced to praying on this matter. Other groups that think they are strong should be patriotic, settle down and secure their own country.” He thanked the Chadian leader for the visit, giving assurances that, “as a good neighbour, I am prepared at any time to listen to your representations, political, security or any other matter.” President Deby-Itno thanked President Buhari for the support he provides to him and his country as they undertake the ongoing transition to democracy, which he said is going well. He wished President Buhari long life and congratulated him on the ongoing democratic process in Nigeria, adding that, “we hope we will continue to see you even after your departure from office.”
