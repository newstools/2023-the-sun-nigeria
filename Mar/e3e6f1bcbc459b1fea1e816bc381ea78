By Brown Chimezie Eze Ndigbo of Eti-Osa Lagos,  Eze Gerald Onuchukwu Gerico, has admonished  Atiku Abubakar to leave Peter Obi alone and face the retrieval of his alleged stolen presidential mandate with dignity.     The monarch spoke against the backdrop of comment of the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) that the Labour Party’s candidate acted cowardly by opting out of the PDP primary over fear of the caliber of contestants in the race. In a statement, yesterday, Eze Onuchukwu described Atiku’s statement as a diversion from the main issue facing him in the just concluded election.  “It is unfortunate that Alhaji Atiku will leave the reason why he called the press conference, which was to protest irregularities in the election, to malign Peter Obi. This is unacceptable; I will advise  Atiku to behave like a statesman that he claims to be and face his mandate,” he said. The monarch commended Obi for the calm and matured way he has approached the alleged irregularities he claims had marred his victory at the poll. He lauded Obi for having faith in the country’s judiciary, expressing the optimism that the LP candidate would get victory in the court as he once did when he was robbed of victory in Anambra gubernatorial election. “Before he became governor of Anambra State, he used the judiciary to reclaim his mandate. Having done this before, I am sure that he will win again. I am also sure that he has taken a step in the right direction as justice would eventually prevail over impunity.” Eze Onuchukwu also congratulated Imo senator-elect,  Osita Izunaso, Senator Wasiu Eshinlokun of Eti-Osa Central  and other lawmakers who won in the election.
