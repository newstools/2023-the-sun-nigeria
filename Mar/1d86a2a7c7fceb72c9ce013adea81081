The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) said it has seized 1,112 kilogrammes of cannabis sativa from a suspected female drug trafficker in Akwa Ibom State. The NDLEA Commander in the state, Mrs Obot Bassey, said this, yesterday, in a press statement issued in Uyo. Bassey said the suspect, Hope David, 42, was arrested by NDLEA operatives in Abak Local Government Area of the state, on March 5. “Preliminary investigation revealed that the entire family engages in the illicit trade. However, as of the time of the arrest, the husband of the suspect, Iniobong David Duff, was nowhere to be found, but investigation has commenced, in order to bring the perpetrators to justice,” he added. The commander said the NDLEA would continue to comb out and arrest drug merchants in the state, while rehabilitating addicts to make them useful to the society. Bassey solicited the support of all stakeholders, including traditional rulers and youth leaders, in the campaign against substance abuse and illicit drug trafficking.
