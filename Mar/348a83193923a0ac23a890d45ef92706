Benue State Governor, Samuel Ortom, has said there are violations of the Electoral Act in the conduct of both the presidential and National Assembly elections. Ortom, in a statement, yesterday, by his spokesperson, Terver Akase, however, called on the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) not to ignore the concerns of Nigerians, emphasising that many have questioned the credibility of the elections. He said though a number of violations of the Electoral Act were witnessed in the conduct of the polls, his team was assessing the situation and would make its position known soon.  He said despite the pre-election apprehensions, voters in the 23 local government areas of the state went out to exercise their civic responsibility and no major breach of peace has been recorded in any part of the state. Ortom appreciated Benue people across party lines for the peaceful conduct of the polls, even as he urged INEC to take steps to save the country from crisis. “I urge the people of the state to remain calm, law abiding and as peaceful as they have been. I commend the resilience of those who were able to vote during the elections despite the current economic situation in the country,” he said. The governor particularly thanked the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state for its support and assured he would continue to provide leadership to unite the party and strengthen the family bond among members, ahead of the March 11 governorship and state Assembly elections. He further expressed gratitude to those who voted for him during the Benue North West senatorial election, stating that the massive show of love and support had encouraged him.
