By Chukwudi Nweje The defeat of seven of the 10 sitting governors that contested in the February 25, 2023, parliamentary elections is a strong statement that the National Assembly is no longer a guaranteed retirement place for state governors who had completed their terms of office. Governors Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia), Atiku Bagudu (Kebbi), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Simon Lalong (Plateau) and Ben Ayade (Cross River) all lost their bid to metamorphose from their executive seats to the legislative chamber. The fate of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal is twisting in the wind as the Independent National Electoral commission (INEC) declared the three senatorial seat elections in the state inconclusive. Governors Dave Umahi of Ebonyi State and Abubakar Bello (Niger) were however elected. The defeat of the governors at the senatorial polls is instructive because since the advent of the 4th Republic in 1999, particularly from 2007 when the first set of elected governors completed the maximum two-terms of four years each, many of them have conveniently transformed into senators using the power of incumbency at their disposal to pave their way. The results of the already conducted National assembly elections indicate that Nigerians have had enough of governors automatically retiring to the Senate by flexing their power of incumbency which they use to pick the ticket of the dominant parties as it were. Prior to the 2023 poll, elections in Nigeria had been a two-horse race whereby merely picking your party’s ticket is an almost guarantee of victory depending on the state of the country. The 2023 election is different because it is a three-horse or perhaps a four-horse race depending on the analyst. The election has seen the ‘big’ parties ─ the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and the All Progressive Congress (APC) ─ and their ‘powerful’ candidates lose election in states previously thought to be their stronghold. Analysts argue that the craze of governors to transform to legislators at the upper legislature is not unconnected to the largesse and perks of public office in Nigeria. For instance, the allowances and resources controlled by the governors are so enormous that many of them cannot imagine of a life without such after their two-terms in office, thus they desire to move on to the National Assembly where there is no term limitation. Governors who lost the  Senate bid Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi Enugu State, like most other states in the South East, had been a PDP stronghold since 1999 but Gov Ugwuanyi lost his senatorial bid to a much smaller and newer party, the Labour Party (LP). The LP candidate, Okechukwu Ezea trounced Ugwuanyi by a whooping 104,948 votes as against the 46,948 votes garnered by the sitting governor. Ben Ayade Ayade, the All Progressives Congress (APC) Senatorial candidate for Cross River North failed in his attempt to return to the Senate where he represented his constituency from 2011 to 2015. He was defeated by the incumbent, Jarigbe Agom-Jarigbe of the PDP who polled 76,145 votes against his 56,595. Darius Ishaku Taraba State Governor, Darius Ishaku could not deliver the Southern Senatorial District of the state to PDP as he lost to Mr David Jimkuta of the APC.

The INEC declared the three senatorial seats in the state inconclusive following the cancellation of some polling units due to over-voting and disruption of election. Sokoto South Senatorial district is being contested by Gov. Tambuwal of PDP, the incumbent, Sen. Abdullahi Danbaba, of the APC, among other candidates. Sokoto North Senatorial district was declared inconclusive following the cancellation of some polling units involving 121,010 registered voters. Sokoto East Senatorial district was also declared inconclusive.  Governors going to the Senate  While some governors would be retiring to their private businesses if they have any, some others would be metamorphosing from chief executive to lawmaker.
