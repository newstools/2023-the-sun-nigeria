By Lukman Olabiyi Sixty -two communities in the Eti-Osa Local Government Area of Lagos State have told the state governor, Mr. Babajide Sanwo-Olu, not to entertain any fear regarding his victory at the forthcoming governorship and state assembly elections that will hold on March 11. The communities and their leaders said the result of last presidential poll in the area, was not the true reflection of their voting pattern but they have learned their lesson. Speaking on behalf of the communities and their leaders at a press conference yesterday, the chairman Baale’s Forum, Wasiu Ali-Balogun, assured the All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate of victory, when residents file out to cast their votes. Ali-Balogun urged residents of Eti-Osa to put behind  the outcome of the presidential election, and come out  enmasse to vote the All Progressives Congress candidates, stressing that the governor has done so much for the state and deserves to be given a second term in office. He admitted that there were lots of irregularities during the presidential election, while also adding that security would be beefed up to ensure safety. Other communities leaders who also spoke at the press briefing, urged the governor to count on them, promising that they would support and deliver votes for him in the area as he had been very supportive to people in the area, which had also witnessed massive socio-economic development during his tenure.
