From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State Governor, Nyesom  Wike, said the ongoing campaigns for candidates of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the state does not include the party’s presidential candidate. He said this was because no understanding had been brokered for such level of support to be given by the state. The Governor spoke in Bonny Town during the Local Government Campaign Flag-off Rally organised by the Rivers State PDP Campaign Council on Tuesday. The Rivers State governor told Bonny peoples: “Go home and have it on your mind that the PDP in Rivers State, we have taken governorship, we have taken the senatorial, we have taken the House of Representatives and we have taken the House of Assembly. “That is the election we are doing here. These are the ones (candidates) who told me to come and campaign for them. No other person told me to campaign for him. I can’t force myself to campaign for you when you have not asked for it. These ones (candidates) have told me, so, I’ve come here to campaign. If somebody asks you to work for him, you’ll work for him. But if they don’t want you to work for them, will you force them?” Governor Wike pointed out that anybody who says  Rivers State is inconsequential will suffer repercussion for ignoring it. The governor enjoined all residents in the State to be rest assured that no intimidation and propaganda that can cause a distraction from the political path that has been so chosen.
