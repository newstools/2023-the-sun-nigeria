There was a mammoth crowd, yesterday,  at the newly constructed Township Stadium, Nsukka, as jubilant teachers and students from Enugu North Senatorial District under the Post Primary Schools Management Board (PPSMB) converged on the facility to thank God for the emergence of students of Enugu State as the best in the 2022 West African Examinations Council (WAEC) exams.  They also held prayer rally in support of Enugu State Governor and candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) for Enugu North Senatorial District, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, and other PDP candidates in the state, in appreciation of the governor’s exemplary leadership qualities and commitment to the welfare of the teachers as well as the entrenchment of peace and good governance in the state. They said Ugwuanyi has displayed enormous commitment to the wellbeing of the teachers of Enugu State, through regular payment of salaries, release of the 2021/2022 teachers promotion, provision of critical infrastructure in schools such as educational facilities and construction/renovation of classroom blocks, among others. Led by the Chairman of PPSMB, Evangelist Dr. Favour Ugwuanyi, the teachers assured Ugwuanyi that they are resolute in their prayers and support for his landslide victory at the poll, and that of other candidates of the PDP in the state including the Party’s governorship candidate, Dr. Peter Ndubuisi Mbah.  They expressed gratitude to God for the outstanding performance of students of Enugu State in the 2022 WAEC examinations, disclosing that the feat was a result of Ugwuanyi’s interventions in the education sector of the state. Reiterating their unalloyed support for the Governor Ugwuanyi’s senatorial campaign, the teachers reassured him that they will vote massively for him and other candidates of the PDP in recognition of his good works in the sector in particular and the state in general.
