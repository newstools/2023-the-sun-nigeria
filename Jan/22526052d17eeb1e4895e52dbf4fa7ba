The Eze Ndigbo of Ifako Ijaye Lagos, Eze Michael Ezekwobi (Oyioma la tu Ndigbo gba gburugburu) has thrown his support behind calls by the National Assembly and the Senate for the extension of the new cash policy by six months. In a statement, the Royal Father who has been constant in his criticism of the cashless policy and the cash limitation policy, said in view of the unavailability of the new denomination of N200, N500 and N1000 notes at POS and banks, the most reasonable step the CBN could take was to listen to the Senate and Reps by extending the policy for at least 6 months Eze Ezekwobi recalled that he lost N2000 in1983, to the new cash policy when President Muhammadu Buhari, then military Head of state changed the currency. He said many Nigerians lost their money to the policy which was poorly executed without human face. While lamenting over the scarcity of the new note, Ezekwobi said.” It is absurd that the CBN Governor would continue to tell us to go to the bank and deposit the old currencies and by the time you go to collect money from the counter, POS, and ATM, what you get is old currencies. On the fuel scarcity which is bitting harder across the country, Ezekwobi condemned policy makers who has turned blind eyes to the predicament of the suffering masses. “ Today, people buy fuel as high as 450 naira in the south east, while it Cost as high as 350 naira in Lagos and Abuja. such lopsided pricing when the government of the day claimed to pay subsidy and diced price at 165 naira per liters amounts to a very big scam where the masses are at the casualties at the receiving ends”, he said.
