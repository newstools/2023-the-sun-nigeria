Afrobeats singer, Kizz Daniel is at it again. This New Year, his creative energy and tunnel vision have come to play, as he drops another hit alongside visuals of his highly anticipated single, Rich Till I Die (RTID). Produced by Reward Beatz and co-produced by Blaise Beatz, the single is a perfect reflection of hard work, diligence, resilience, and a summation of his musical journey so far. The musical cocktail has the gifted artiste in a state of thankfulness, especially visible through lyrics that are enshrined in proverbs and wise sayings throughout a sound whose chorus is nothing short of a prayer. Breathing life into the Afropop poster tune, video director, TG Omori stamped his signature on the RTID visuals. This showcased depth and dexterity in capturing the very essence of this nostalgic tune. It also displayed the luxurious life of Kizz Daniel in line with part of the song’s lyrics, “I live the life I want. I love the life I live”, as well as blending the odd pieces in between with corresponding visual frames. This makes the RTID visuals a guaranteed pick-me-up for everyone wishing for a little bit more affirmation and inspiration, as they head into the New Year! Hard on the heels of his masterpieces – Buga and Cough (ODO), which moved the world with millions of streams and views across several social media and digital platforms, Kizz Daniel teased his audiences locally and internationally with a snippet of RTID via his Instagram page, which garnered instant reactions with his fans yearning for the full song.  The widely acclaimed singer, who has had incredibly successful singles and albums that have gone on to become street anthems across Africa and the world, has become almost a mini-god in knowing the exact type of music to dish out, and continually fan the flame of good music for his fans in Nigeria, Africa and the world.
