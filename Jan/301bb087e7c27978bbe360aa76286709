For pretty Nollywood actress, Imade Osawaru, being single doesn’t make her feel bad. The Edo State-born script interpreter recently disclosed to Saturday Sun how she copes on cold, lonely nights as a spinster. “There are things that are more important than sex to me right now, and I have never used a sex toy before. I don’t even own any. So, I cope on such (lonely) nights as usual,” she said. On the qualities she wants in her man, Osawaru stated, “He must be loving and caring. And we both need to have money, because money turns me on. I can’t date or marry a man who thinks he is a mini-god and doesn’t respect women or allow my own opinion. Such characters turn me off.” Speaking on sexual harassment in the entertainment industry, Osawaru says she welcomes admirers but there are limits to love advances. “Anyone and everyone can admire me from afar; either on social media or on screen. I am a lady and a beautiful one at that, so it’s no big deal and it’s not a must I agree to every of my admirer. I have never experienced any form of domestic violence and I know there are punishments under the constitution for offenders. What I think should be done is that those punishments should be implemented if anyone is found guilty of domestic violence. This will help curb domestic violence in our society.”
