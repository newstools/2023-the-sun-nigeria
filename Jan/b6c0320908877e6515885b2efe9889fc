From Sylvanus Viashima, Jalingo Students of  Taraba State University Jalingo, yesterday ,went on  rampage over cancellation of their semester examinations. The academic and non- academic staff of the school resolved to boycott the examination which was billed to start yesterday, following the state Government’s refusal to pay their 10  months outstanding salaries. The Students, who arrived the  school on Monday morning, ready for the  examinations found the examinations Halls locked  up in keys ,became agitated. Daily Sun gathered that shortly before midday, the agitations which were basically mild at first, later became violent as the  students started burning used tires on the roads; blocking  major roads in the  town, and obstructing movements. The students matched to the Government House to register their displeasure over the development; warning  that if the state Governor failed to tackle the issue and give them the opportunity to write the  examinations, there would be no elections in the state. Staff of the institution last week ,protested round the school, over non payment of their salaries, and threatened to boycott the exammination should the government failed to pay them. The university staff,led by Mr. Solomon Ishaya Audu, the NASU Chairman ,and Bitrus Joseph Ajibauka ,the SSANU Chairman in their protest letter presented to the Vice Chancellor of the school, Professor Sunday Bako, demanded,”the payment of the outstanding salary balance of March,and June 2022. Payment of the outstanding responsibility, and hazard allowances for September 2021, payment of the 75% outstanding third party deductions of October 2021, payment of the outstanding full salaries of July to December, 2022.
