A group of professional elites consisting of Enugu indigenes living in Canada, has thrown its weight behind the governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, Dr. Peter Mbah, assuring of their unflinching commitment in ensuring he emerges the next governor of the state. The group under the auspice of Enugu Diaspora Canada stated that they arrived at their decision after a critical, exhaustive debate and proper scrutiny of the credentials of all governorship candidates in the state. It maintained that it has confidence in Dr. Mbah’s capacity to stamp out insecurity, insulate the state from the raging national socio-economic challenges through his leadership experiences garnered over the years from both the private and the public sectors.  Dr. Mbah’s leadership competence and credentials will trigger industrial revolution, create massive jobs for the youths, transform the status of the state through a sustainable pace in wealth creation, quality and affordable education and habitable environment for the citizens to fulfill their potentials, said. It also commended the oil and gas entrepreneur for his issue-based and focused campaigns while refusing to engage in personal attacks as notoriously known of some candidates in the state, promising to continue to mobilize their people to rally round his candidacy. Speaking on behalf of the group, Mr. Lucky Ogbodo expressed their readiness to partner with the state under Dr. Mbah’s leadership to bring more investments to the people.  While donating some campaign items, he stated that most of the Enugu professionals living in Canada are into different businesses, and would be glad to key into the robust programmes and development plans of the governorship candidate.
