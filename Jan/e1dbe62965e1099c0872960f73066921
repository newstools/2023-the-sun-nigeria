A Federal High Court sitting in Yenagoa has granted an injunction against Bayelsa United from featuring in the Nigeria Premier Football League (NPFL) on account of their indebtedness to Nembe City FC. BSNSports.com.ng gathered on Saturday from a post shared on Sports World WhatsApp Group that the order was made on January 16 by Justice Isa M.Dashen and this has since been served to the other defendants in the matter, the Interim Management Committee and the NFF. The hearing in suit No FHC/YNG/CS/1/2023 has been fixed for February 9, 2023. It would be recalled that Nembe City made a formal complaint to the Interim Management Company(IMC) regarding Bayelsa Unitedâ€™s indebtedness to them. The debts include 15 Million Naira being outstanding payments to Nembe City FC over the transfer of three players in 2014. The players in question are Ebitimi Agogo, Sobomabo West and Opubo Japhet. Bayelsa United have won promotion back to the top flight after many years in the lower league. However, their huge debt profile runs counter to new Club Licensing requirements and thus disqualifies a club from featuring in the top division.
