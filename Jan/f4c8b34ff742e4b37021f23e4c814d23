Super Falcons and Barcelona Femeni star Asisat Oshoala has thrown shades at Chelsea and its fans following their defeat against Fulham. The Blues were expected to have a smooth visit at the Craven Cottage Stadium, but the host was the best as they grabbed all points with a 2-1 victory against Chelsea. Graham Potter has been faced with a lot of criticism from his side following their poor run since they resumed their post-World Cup fixtures. The fans, however, have not been given something to cheer for so far in the 2022-23 season campaign, having suffered more embarrassment being shown the exit door by Manchester City. And yesterday evening, Chelsea suffered their third straight defeat and was also a night to forget for new signing Joao Felix, who saw a straight red card for a dangerous challenge on his debut.
