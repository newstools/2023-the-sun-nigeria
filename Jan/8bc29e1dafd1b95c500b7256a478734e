From Layi Olanrewaju, Ilorin Tens of thousands of Kwara residents waved ecstatically on the streets of Ilorin to welcome APC presidential candidate Asiwaju Bola Tinubu and other dignitaries to the state for the party’s campaign flag-off. The candidate, his running mate, Kashim Shettima, and party chairman Abdullahi Adamu arrived in the city around 3:30 pm in the company of several APC leaders and apparatchiks and were received by Governor Abdulrahman Abdulrazaq and a legion of APC candidates and leaders from across the state of harmony. It was a rally like no other in the recent history of the state, with security agencies struggling to clear the human traffic that heralded Asiwaju’s arrival to the city of Sheikh Alimi. He waved the broom and danced to the different tunes of music crooned by supporters and admirers alike. On the welcome train were Minister of Information Lai Mohammed, the three senators from Kwara and their colleagues from Kogi and other parts of Nigeria, cabinet members, APC candidates, and hundreds of party stalwarts — many donning the Emilokan cap, others adorned with the insignia of his cap. Accompanied by a motorcade that stretched a few kilometres, the double-decker Marco Polo bus conveying Tinubu and the dignitaries got locked in suffocating human traffic formed by thousands of supporters and admirers who lined the streets from the Ilorin International Airport. The convoy is now headed to the venue of the rally, spending over one hour between the airport and Gaa Odota — the neighbourhood next to the airport. The candidate and the entourage will go pay homage to the Emir and then head to the campaign ground where thousands of party supporters are waiting for speeches from the candidate and official handing over of flags to the candidates, including Governor Abdulrazaq, who is running for a second term on his record of bringing governance closer to the grassroots, strengthening infrastructure, empowering women and young people, and for the first time creating a formal structure to cater for the poor and the vulnerable.
