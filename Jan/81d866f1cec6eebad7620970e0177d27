By Chinelo Obogo            talktonelo@yahoo.com  Flight ticket prices have continued to fluctuate since this year as domestic airlines take steps to further stimulate demand following an apparent lull in demand and  passenger traffic.    Consequently economy tickets now range from N40,000 to N70,000, depending on the airline, depature time and route.   President of the National Association of Air Pilots and Engineers (NAAPE), Abednego Galadima, told Daily Sun that a lull in passenger traffic is often common at the beginning of every year after many passengers have returned from their Yuletide celebrations. He said it was usually the case that as passenger traffic drops, airlines will slash prices in order to fill up seats. “We are in off -season at the moment when passengers don’t usually travel much and  airlines know that if they hike ticket prices, they might not get customers.  I am a very frequent traveler but I haven’t travelled in a while and that is the same with most people. The beginning of the year usually experiences a lull in the sector, so airlines have to adjust their prices to the reality on ground,” he said. In the week preceding the Christmas celebrations, domestic airlines recorded a high spike in ticket sales with a source in Air Peace telling Daily Sun that the airline experienced up to 50 percent increase in over-the-counter sales of tickets and almost 100 percent load factor for many of its routes especially in the South East. Spokesperson of Dana Air, Kingsley Ezenwa, also confirmed the increase in passenger traffic to Daily Sun in the week preceding the Yuletide but acknowledged that such increase is usually expected during festive seasons.

Airlines however, have continued to inform their passengers of possibility of flight disruptions due to persistent scarcity of aviation fuel and unpredictable weather conditions. Cost of Jet A1 has remained at N800 per litre and Prof. Obiora Okonkwo, who is the spokesman of Airline Operators of Nigeria (AON), said any disruptions in scheduled flight operations is due to the scarcity of fuel or bad weather which may cause airlines to reschedule or cancel flights. Former Rector, Nigerian College of Aviation Technology (NCAT), Zaria, Captain Samuel Caulcrick, said in an interview recently than in order to solve the problem of scarcity, the Federal government should get involved in the provision and availability of aviation fuel in a bid to save the airlines operational cost. “Also, when it comes to Jet A1, the government doesn’t want to get involved, but I think the government should get involved in Jet A1, not as an importer. The government has Jet A1 reserve for the Air Force because of security. “So, the Air Force cannot rely on suppliers for Jet A1 to fly their jets. Government should be able to look into that reserve at times to save the commercial sector especially when the scarcity of the product is alarming or if there is a price hike and the government wants to subsidise it,” he said. ”The government can call the fuel marketers and buy the product off them and sell at subsidised rate for the airlines. This is necessary because the government is taking money back from every airline that flies because the airlines are paying charges,” he said.
