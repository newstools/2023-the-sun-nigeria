…calls for due process By GILBERT EKEZIE The South-South zonal council of the National Conscience Party (NCP) has disassociated itself from the purported endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, as the NCP presidential Candidate. The council disclosed this at an emergency zonal meeting held on Tuesday, January 24th, 2023 via Virtual Zoom Platform. Zonal leaders of the NCP stated that the meeting was organised to review the decisions and resolutions at the just concluded National Consultative Council (NCC) Meeting of the Party which was held in Abuja on January 21 and 22, 2023 and took a position on them; reviewed the roles of individual members from the Zone that attended the said NCC Meeting; set up a Disciplinary Committee to investigate their roles at the meeting and presented appropriate recommendations to the Zonal leadership for consideration. One of such resolutions which was done without the consensus of the generality of the party members and critical stakeholders, was the endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, as the candidate of the NCP. The group stated, “The South-South Zonal Council in session dissociates itself from the purported adoption of Mr Peter Obi, the Presidential Candidate of the Labour as the NCP Presidential Candidate, and such resolution is not binding on the Zone.” The South- South Zonal Council also stated that the zone is ready to support any candidate that is a product of due process “The Zone under the leadership of the National Deputy Chairman (South-South) and other NDCs from the other geo-political zones of Nigeria would support any candidate that have been collectively agreed upon, not the one sponsored by Mallam Tanko Yunusa just to please his paymaster in the Labour Party. We reject the adoption in its entirety.” Recalled that the Chairman of the National Conscience Party (NCP), Mallam Tanko Yunusa has taken up an appointment as the Spokesperson of the Labour Party and the zonal leaders of the party have advised him to resign from NCP, both as a chairman and member of the party, arguing that it is illegal, unconstitutional and morally unjustifiable for him to belong to two political parties at the same time.
