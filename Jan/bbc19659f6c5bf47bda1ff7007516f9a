From Noah Ebije, Kaduna Former Secretary General of Arewa Consultative Forum (ACF), Mr. Anthony Sani has said that endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi by the former President Olusegun Obasanjo lacked electoral value in view of such precedent. Obasanjo had in his new message publicly threw his weight behind the Labour Party presidential candidate, for formal endorsement of his (Obi) presidential ambition. The endorsement has since generated different reactions across the country, with some people faulting, and others supporting Obasanjo. However, Mr. Sani in his own reaction told Daily Sun, “The endorsement of Mr Peter Obi of Labour Party by former President Olusegun Obasanjo may not confer any electoral values on Peter Obi. “Before the elections of 2019,some of us had said the former president was not the conscience of the nations or statesman as he would like Nigerians to believe,given his undue partisan activities. “However, former President Obasanjo has constitutional right to endorse a presidential candidate of his choice.But as a former president and given his age,one would expect him to be a statesman who should not dabble into partisan politics unduly. “I reacted to former President Obasanjo when he endorsed former VP Atiku in 2019 by saying that the only consistent thing about the former president is his inconsistency. I cited some examples such as tearing his membership card of PDP and saying bye bye to partisan politics only to join ADC and later back to PDP in order to endorse former VP Atiku for 2019 elections which the former VP lost despite the endorsement. “Atiku Abubakar could not prevail on the elections precisely because the inconsistency of his former boss cost loss of confidence by Nigerians”.
