From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja The Chairman/CEO, Nigerians in Diaspora Commission (NIDCOM), Abike Dabiri-Erewa, has described the appointment of Dr Ijeoma Akunyili, daughter of the late Prof. Dora Akunyili, as the Chief Medical Officer of the Jersey City Medical Center, an RWJ Barnabas Health facility, in the United States of America, as well- deserved and not surprising. In a congratulatory statement made available to newsmen by the Head of Media, Public Relations and Protocols Unit, NiDCOM, Abuja, Abdur-Rahman Balogun, she said the appointment is not surprising knowing the kind of training she received from her late mother, a disciplinarian to the core.

She implored other Nigerian youths to be inspired by the achievement of Dr Ijeoma Akunyili, and help Oprah the country in a positive light. Dr Akunyili, according to a statement released on the official website of the centre, is the first African American medical professional to serve in the role. Speaking on her appointment, Ijeoma was quoted as saying “I am grateful for this opportunity, and I look forward to serving the residents of Hudson County and continuing to provide safe, innovative, efficient, and equitable care. “It is a true privilege to lead the clinical effort at Jersey City Medical Center and to create sustainable health outcomes for our community.” Dora Akunyili who died in 2014, served as the Director-General of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control of Nigeria (NAFDAC) from 2001 to 2008 and was later appointed Minister of Information and Communications.
