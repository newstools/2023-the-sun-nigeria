The National Association of Igbo Youths (NAIY), the umbrella organization of all Igbo youths, has described as mischievous the statement credited to a certain spokesman of Senator Bola Tinubu in the South East region, Mr. Josef Onoh, that the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu has named Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi of Enugu State as “the latest partner in progress.” In a statement, yesterday, the group said: “Of course we recall that Governors Ugwuanyi was one of those who constitute the famed G5, a group of five aggrieved governors of the main opposition party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and recently received the Bola Tinubu team that came to the state to campaign. But that outing must not be construed to be an underhand dealing by Governor Ugwuanyi. Such a claim by Mr. Josef Onoh  is unfounded, a blatant lie and a gross misinformation as well as misrepresentation of facts. “Ugwuanyi is presently one of the G5 Governors of the PDP and a Senatorial candidate on the platform of the party and knows the implications of such a purported decision. If Governor Ugwuanyi has taken such a decision, Mr. onoh should not be the proper person to make the announcement since the Governor is still very much alive and has not made any public declaration or personal comment to that effect. With top media aides and associates around him how can a regional spokesperson of a different political party,  speak or make such sensitive political declaration for Governor Ugwuanyi. “Our defense for Governor Ugwuanyi is borne out of the fact that he has made positive impact as Governor and as a true Igbo son and leader whose political vision for the country and Igbo race is outstanding. We advise amateur politicians of Mr Onoh’s class not to embark on an ignoble trip of dragging the image and integrity of our political leaders into odium with statements that lack authenticity.”
