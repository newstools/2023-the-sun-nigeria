From Okey Sampson, Umuahia A man, Christian Ede, has allegedly died inside the cell of the Nigeria Police Force, Ndiegoro Division in Aba, Abia State. Ede, a father of four, and a native  of Ndiagu Akpugo in Nkanu West local government area of Enugu State was  detained at Ndiegoro Police Divisiion, where he died. It was gathered that Ede allegedly died as a result of the injuries he sustained from torture from  policemen. Ede, was said to have been detained at the Ndiegoro Police Division after his neighbour in the market accused him of stealing goods from his shop. Efforts by our Correspondent to reach the wife of the deceased, Chinwe Ede, was not successful. However, a source close to the family, said Ede could not have died if efforts to bail him by his relations were not rebuffed by the police at Ndiegoro, who allegedly insisted the deceased must pay up the money worth the amount of the said goods he was alleged to have stolen from the said neighbor’s shop before he would be granted bail. The source further hinted that it was after about one week  in detention,Ede’s family got a call from the police that they should report at the police station, as their relation had slumped in the cell. The deceased was reportedly rushed to a private hospital where he was confirmed dead. Ede’s body was later deposited in a morgue. Abia State Police Public Relations Officer, Mr. Geoffrey Ogbonna,denied the allegation, saying that anybody died in any police cell in Abia.
