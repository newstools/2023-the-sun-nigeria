From Adanna Nnamami, Abuja Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi has given insight into why the collection of the, Permanent Voters Cards, PVC and voting in the forthcoming elections on February 25, 2023 is critical to Nigeria and Nigerians. In a special broadcast he made via the social media, on Thursday, Obi said every Nigerian youths and elders alike must endeavour to collect their PVC because without it what the youths and many other concerned persons are desiring for Nigeria this year may not be realizable. “This is a critical and existential election for Nigeria and all of us must endeavour to vote and we can only vote if we have our PVC,” he said. The LP flag-bearer, one of the frontline candidates in the February 25, 2023 poll reminded Nigerians that the collection of the PVC ends On Sunday January 2023. The Independent National Electoral Commission, (INEC) had opened the collection of PVCs at ward level today Friday January 6, 2023 and would end on 15, January 2023 after which the collection continues at the INEC offices at local Government levels until January 22, 2023. Meanwhile the Labour Party Candidate has continued to receive the support and positive rating of prominent Nigerians.
