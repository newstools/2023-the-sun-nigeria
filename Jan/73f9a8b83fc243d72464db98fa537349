From Tony John, Port Harcourt  MR. Bestman Lekia, popularly called Biggie, has been convicted and sentenced to death by hanging, by a Rivers State High Court sitting in Port Harcourt.  The judgement was passed on the convict for the killing of four people, and using an intestine to prepare meal, as well as burning of buildings in a community in Khana Local Government Area of the state.  Lekia and others now at large were reported to have killed Gbodu Nobaale, Etim Ekpe, Nenalebarri Mmeabe and Loveday Mmeabe in 2019.  They (Lekia and others) reportedly kidnapped the first victim and took him to another place where his intestines were used to prepare plantain meal in Okwalie community in Khana area.  The trial judge, Justice Adolphus Enebeli, in his judgement yesterday, found Lekia guilty of murder, kidnapping, cult- ism and armed robbery, stating that the prosecution counsel proved his case with the necessary evidence and presenta- tions.  Justice Enebeli said even the attitude of Lekia throughout his trial proved that he was a hardened criminal, cultist and terror, who, if possible, was supposed to be hung four times and die four times. Hence, he ruled that Lekia should be hanged on his neck until he is confirmed dead.In an interview with newsmen shortly after the judgement, the state prosecution counsel, Chidi Ekeh, described the judgement as an erudite one that would save Ogoni community and Rivers State at large.  Ekeh said although he was not happy that some- body’s life would be cut short, he insisted that the law and state would have failed, if they had allowed the convict to go free without facing justice.
