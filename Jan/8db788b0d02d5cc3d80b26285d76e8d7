From Okey Sampson, Umuahia African Action Congress (AAC), has declared Omoyele Sowore as its national chairman and presidential candidate for the coming 2023 elections, and Ina Okopi- Agu as the national secretary. In the same vein, the party said the authentic Abia State Chairman of AAC, is Ezumaibe Kelechiukwu. In a release signed by Kelechukwu, State Chairman and Ijoma Ogbonnaya, state Publicity Secretary of AAC, the party said its stand stemmed from the judgment of the Court of Appeal. The release drew attention to the  judgments of the Court of Appeal of Thursday, June 2, 2022 and the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja of December 5, 2022, removing Leonard Nzenwa and others from their positions in the party. “The party’s authentic National Chairman is Comrade Omoyele Sowore who is the Presidential Candidate of the party. The Party’s National Secretary is Comrade Ina Okopi- Agu as affirmed by the Court of Appeal.” The party described as absolute falsehood, the insinuation in some quarters that her governorship candidate, Chief Bond Ohuche, endorsed Alex Otti of Labour Party for the governorship seat. “African Action Congress (AAC) is not in alliance with Labour Party  or any other party in Abia State, therefore the purported endorsement shouldn’t have risen”. While urging the public to beware of impostors, the release said the party has all it takes to redeem Abia if elected.
