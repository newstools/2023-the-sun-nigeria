From Paul Osuyi, Asaba The  Delta State Police Command had  arrested a suspected/speculator, Sunday Okafor, who is alleged to be leading a gang illegally invading people’s land to extort money in Ibusa, Oshimili North Local Government Area of the state. Delta State Public Relations Officer (PPRP), DSP Bright Edafe, who confirmed the arrest to our correspondent in Asaba, said the suspect was apprehended for alleged arson and kidnapping in the community. Edafe said the police acted on a petition by the community, adding that when the suspect’s house was raided, one shot  gun and eight live ammunition were recovered, adding that investigation was in progress. Two leaders of the community, Chekwube Ofuonyeadi, and Jerome Ikebude, had through their counsel, Emwanta Ekenemolise Osifo (Esq) petitioned the police over alleged criminal activities of the suspect and members of his gang. They alleged that the suspect and one Nwanze were earlier arrested on January 13 for allegedly abducting Ikebude, who is the chairman of a camp settlement at Akwugboko, Umuolo, in Umueze quarters, Ibusa and allegedly robbing him of N1.2 million. They lamented that the suspects were reportedly released two days later after their unnamed sponsors intervened and bailed them with huge sum of money. According to the petitioners, the suspects went back to the area and allegedly set the buildings, farm produce and timber logs ablaze. In the petition, the community leaders prayed the police to restrain the hoodlums from further causing damage, restore peace and security of lives and property in the affected community The petitioners urged the CP to, where necessary, prosecute and lawfully employ every action possible to deter the hoodlums and ensure justice in the alleged cases of terrorism, cultism, arson, unlawful possession of firearms, attempted murder, kidnapping, armed robbery and acts generally calculated to incite violence and breach of public peace against them.
