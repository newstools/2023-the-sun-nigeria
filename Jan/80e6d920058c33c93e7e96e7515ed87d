All Progressives Congress presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, yesterday, in Yola, Adamawa State, called on the people to vote the first female governor in the country. He was canvassing support for the party’s governorship candidate in the state, Ayisatu Ahmed Binani, saying she has all it takes to become governor. “She is brilliant, driven and results-oriented. He will perform better for the state,” he said at a well-attended rally at the Maidoki Ground in Yola. Speaking about President Muhammadu Buhari who was present at the rally, Tinubu hailed him for laying a solid foundation for the country, which he would build on if elected. He also thanked the president for attending the rally, saying he was deeply moved and honoured by his presence. “Your contributions are positive and enduring. As I have said before, when the history of this period is objectively written, it will treat you very kindly. It will treat you as a true patriot and hero. Thank you for providing the solid and strong foundation. Now, it will be up to the rest of us to carry on and build Nigeria into the finest national edifice we can envision,” he said. Taking a swipe again at the Peoples Democratic Party presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, he said: “I hear that a former vice president who comes from Adamawa wants to return to Aso Villa again. You have to decide whether you owe him your vote simply because he is from here or do you owe yourself a better nation and future?”
