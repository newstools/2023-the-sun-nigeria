Chief Executive Officer of Monimichelle Group, Ebi Egbe has tasked both the federal government and state governments to pay more attention to sports facilities in the new year. Egbe said Nigeria has the potential of ruling the sporting world if the right facilities are put in place at home. He stressed that given the kind of talents the country boosts of; no African country can compete with Nigeria if we have modern sporting facilities. Egbe, while wishing the country well in 2023 noted that Morocco’s superb performance in Qatar at the FIFA World Cup is a fallout of the kind of facilities they have. “My appeal is that the federal and state governments should look into the area of facilities in 2023. We need to have more modern sporting facilities in the country. In football in particular, we need to have sustainable world class pitches that are TV friendly for our league to grow. We need to train more grounds men that can properly maintain the pitches. My outfit, Monimichelle is ready to provide our expertise in this area,” Egbe said.
