The Certified Institute of Forensics and Fraud Investigators of Nigeria (CIFCFIN) said it would build Nigerian College of Forensics and Fraud Investigators (NCFFI), before the end of this year to aid the war against corruption. The college will fast track the training and retraining of law enforcement personnel in scientific investigations and the deployment of technology for accelerated prosecution of corruption cases, financial crimes and cybercrimes, among others. President and Chairman, Governing Council of CIFCFIN, Dr. Iliyasu Gashinbaki stated this at the unveiling of the Institute’s charter by statute in Abuja. He said the college, which will be domiciled at EFCC Academy, Abuja is part of the Institute’s strategic alliance with the commission. He said the deployment of forensic technology would lead to qualitative investigation, sound prosecution and high conviction rates. “The days of using 10 years to investigate and prosecute corruption cases are over,” he declared. “The institute will also save Nigerians millions of dollars as capital flight to hire foreign forensic experts; significantly reduce loses due to oil theft and assist the federal government on the issue of recovery of looted funds/assets.; significantly reduce revenue leakages in key government revenue generating agencies and end the era of recklessness leading to allegations of huge loss of funds and massive missing revenue by government agencies and minimize corporate financial statement frauds,” he asserted. Gashinbaki heaped praises on President Muhammadu Buhari who assented to the bill for the establishment of CIFCFIN as a chartered Institute on December 23, 2022.  “Mr. President did not just want the institute to examine fraud as we initially intended, but rather to investigate fraud in all its ramifications. The implication of this is far reaching.”
