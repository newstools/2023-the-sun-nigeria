By Gabriel Dike Principal of Federal Government College, Ijanikin, Lagos, did not report the sex scandal involving some of its students to the police. The Education Report investigations also revealed that the Ijanikin Divisional Police did not burst the students in the hotel, as claimed in a report published by a Lagos newspaper. At the college on Thursday, staff and officials of the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) kept mute as they refused to speak with The Education Report. Further investigations indicated that the sex scandal actually happened in November 2022 but was exposed by the video clip of the sex act in a hotel involving FGC Ijanikin students. When our correspondent visited the hotel to find out if government officials or the police had shut it down, it was discovered that the hotel was still open for business. The divisional police officer (DPO), CSP Chinedu Chimereze, told The Education Report that the case was not reported to the station by the college nor did his men burst the students at the hotel. Chimereze said the police public relations officer even called him about the FGC Ijanikin sex scandal and he stated that neither his men nor his division were involved in the matter. “I am not aware of the sexual scandal case involving students of FGC Ijanikin. The division was not involved. The college did not report the matter to us. I heard about it through the PPRO who sought to know details of the case,” he stated. The director (press) Federal Ministry of Education, Abuja, Mr. Benjamin Bem Goong, did not respond to The Education Report’s enquiry about the incident.
