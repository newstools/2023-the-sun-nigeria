By Monica Iheakam Team Nigeria athletes, officials and their counterparts around the world may use air taxis as means of moving around Paris and its environs during the 2024 Olympics. According to news coming out from Paris, hosts of the 2024 Olympics Games, a drone manufacturer, Volocopter, says it wants to make its “air taxis” accessible in the city of Paris in time for the 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The product called Velocity is still in development but the company hopes it can be on the market in time for the Olympics beginning on July 26 2024. “We will certify the machine, which will provide taxi services between Charles de Gaulle [airport] and the centre of Paris; and if it is certified, it means that it’s safe. “So if you see something flying, then it’s safe because we would have certified it, in particular for the Summer Olympic Games of 2024. European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) executive director, Patrick Ky ensured that it would not be rolled out if it had not met standards. “My job is to make sure that the only vehicles which can fly are safe,” said Ky to Euronews. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) gave Paris the hosting rights, after the Tokyo 2020 Olympics.
