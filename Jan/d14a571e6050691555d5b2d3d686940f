The gifted singer, however, disclosed to Saturday Sun how he loves and values his fans, regardless of their genders. “I have never had issues with my female fans. Without my fans, I will not be where I am today. So, I don’t think I have had any weirdest experience with a female fan. “The challenges I faced at the beginning of my music career included getting people to accept my genre of music. When I started out, my genre wasn’t widely recognized and accepted. Artistes who came before me were always seen as uncultured and not given their due respect. But I thank God that has changed. Finance was also a problem for me because I wasn’t born into wealth. I had to build from the scratch without any support or backing. I thank God for how far he has brought me.”
