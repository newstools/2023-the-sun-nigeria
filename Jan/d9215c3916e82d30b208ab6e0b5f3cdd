Nigerian songstress, Uba Iwunwa has advised music stars to channel their creative energies into promoting the rich, cultural heritage, peace, unity and socio-economic progress of the nation, rather than promoting immorality, violence and western culture. Her Majesty, (Dr) Uba Iwunwa (Queen Ugobeze), who is also a Nigerian-Canadian Peace Ambassador, said this during the launch of her single,  Wind of Destiny, co-produced with legendary gospel artiste and Peace Ambassador, His Royal Highness, Eze-Oha, Dr. Felix Ndukwe. “It’s sad that most of the new generation of Nigerian artistes, especially those from the Igbo ethnic group, don’t use their creative skills to promote good things about our society and culture. Rather, they are busy copying western lifestyles and culture. It’s not helping them as well as the society,” she stressed. According to Iwunwa, Wind of Destiny was a tribute as well as clarion call for total liberation of Igboland from shackles of backwardness. In her words: “The song is about the awakening of the spirit of purity, love and unity in Igboland, because no matter where time takes us, there’s no place like home. I am a proud daughter of Igboland, a showcase of cultural diversity globally. I believe it’s time for me to touch the soul of my motherland (Igboland) with a song of freedom, peace, liberation, and hope for my generation and generations unborn.
