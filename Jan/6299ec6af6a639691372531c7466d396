Chairman of the nation’s league interim management body, IMC, Gbenga Elegbeleye has made it clear that the main concern of the IMC ahead of the new season which kicks off January 8 is the welfare of players. In an interview, Elegbeleye said IMC’s vision is to see the players earn well a situation that would see them remain at home instead of rushing to play in obscure countries. He also said the league body would ensure a violence free atmosphere at all venues where the safety of fans and officiating officials would be guaranteed. “We are out to change the narrative of the league. Our main concern and focus is the welfare of the players. We want to see them earn well, good salary package while plying their trade at home. The era when the players earned peanuts would soon end. The present salary which is nothing to write home about informs why they go to obscure countries. That has to stop in the next one or two seasons once we put the right structures in place. And as I said, we are going to ensure all the league venues are safe and TV friendly because we are going to get the matches back on television,” Elegbeleye said. Continuing, the former DG of the defunct National Sports Commission (NSC) said, “On the whole we are looking at the bigger picture in which every stakeholder involved in the league would benefit. We have to make the league better and solid on all fronts.” He also expressed confidence that the 2023 season would kick off as scheduled on January 8 insisting that it is in the best interest of all for the season to be an abridged league.
