From Uche Usim, Abuja  The new naira notes scarcity challenge continued on Tuesday as Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) resumed operations in the new year dispensing  old naira notes slated for withrawal  by January 31. The current development had frustrated many depositors who had their hopes of getting the new notes dashed as they thronged various banks branches.  The insufficiency of the new notes forced the teller clerks to ration them among customers. Many Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) visited by Daily Sun in the FCT also dispensed old notes and in some cases, dirty currency. Angry customers harassed bank teller clerks, querying why old notes were still being dispensed when the deadline to junk them is on the horizon. Point of Sales operators were not spared the new notes scarcity nightmare as many of them lamented that customers were aggressively demanding the notes but were disappointed to learn they had only old notes to transact businesses with. Wole Adebiyi, a university student said he was not comfortable having the old notes with him as he may not have the time to deposit them once full academic programmes resume. “I’m here to get the new notes but they said they’re not available. They said I should use alternative electronic banking channels but network issues won’t let you have that. Besides, many of the traders in Ede, where my school is located, don’t even have the PoS machines. They deal with cash. No cash, no deal. I’m in a dilemma”, he lamented. Another bank customer, Clara Nwachukwu, a PoS operator also lamented, “My customers are on my neck and itching for new notes but the banks say it’s not available. They said we should exercise patience. We’re waiting. The entire banking system is in disarray’. However, sources at the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), told Daily Sun that the new notes shortage was being addressed and urged that the usage of alternative banking channels be deepened.
