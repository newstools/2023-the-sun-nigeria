From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has charged the relevant security agencies to arrest and prosecute the presidential candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar over what he called Atiku gate. Speaking through his Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), Tinubu said that the minimum expectations of many Nigerians in a constructional democracy is to arrest and prosecute Atiku over the revelations from a whistle-blower, Michael Achimugu. The PCC further claimed that the PDP candidate and then vice president, “colluded with his then boss, Olusegun Obasanjo, to fleece the country and steal public funds using what he termed Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs).” “Those SPVs were companies Atiku admittedly registered upon assumption of office as Vice President (with the approval of President Obasanjo) using ‘trusted allies’ as shareholders and companies as consultants and then paid monies into these companies and used those monies to fund the PDP and their private businesses and family activities. “We can all vividly recall that during that tenure, both President Obasanjo and Atiku built the Bells University and American University respectively. Atiku must be arrested and prosecuted. Every money at the Marine Account must be recovered. He must apologise to Nigerians and resign his presidential ambition,” the spokesperson of the PCC, Festus Keyamo, told newsmen at a world press conference.
