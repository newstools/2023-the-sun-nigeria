By Sunday Ani Presidential candidate of the Accord Party in the February 25 poll, Prof Chris Imumolen  has said he would only need 17 million votes to win the election, even as he boasted that he already has 15 million in his kitty. Imumolen stated this, yesterday, when he appeared on a national television programme  monitored in Lagos. He said contrary to Chief Afe Babalola’s belief that only the man with the deepest pocket would win the election and not the best candidate, the election would throw up a lot of surprises. Describing himself as the best candidate, he noted that he represents the ideology that Nigerians have been yearning for. “Nigerians need a vibrant Nigerian that has a track record of achievement privately, and I am that person,” he said. He also dismissed insinuations that only the politician with deep financial resources, wide political party and campaign structures would win election, saying that he would change all that. “We are in the race to change the status quo. It is only the few among the political circle that determines who leads the nation and that is why we are where we are. We are here to change that conventional method of leadership selection. “What I need is 17 million votes to win. We are doing our analysis. We are adopting non conventional system of voting. I have 15 million Nigerians that know me and are willing to vote for me. We don’t do what is conventional. We are going to change the political landscape of Nigeria,” he said.
