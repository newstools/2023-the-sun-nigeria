FC Torino manager Ivan Juric, has revealed that Super Eagles defender Ola Aina is only a few days from returning to competitive action. Aina has been on the treatment table since October due to a tendon injury to his left hamstring that made him miss several games for Torino as well as Nigeria’s friendly defeat to Portugal in November. The full-back’s recovery is going according to plan but he will not be in the Torino squad preparing to trade tackles with Fiorentina in the quarterfinals of the Italian Cup this weekend. The former Chelsea defender is, however, expected to join his Torino teammates in training for the first time this year after the Fiorentina game. Aina could be ready to be in the Torino team to battle Empoli – a side led by former grenade player Paolo Zanetti – next week. Confirming that report at his pre-Fiorentina match conference, Torino manager Ivan Juric noted that “we’ll see Ola Aina next week”. That would be good news for several English clubs, including West Ham United, who are interested in the versatile defender and would need him to prove his fitness before sanctioning a move. Aina’s contract with Torino ends in the summer and he would be desperate to complete a dream return to the English Premier League if no concrete transfer is sealed this January.
