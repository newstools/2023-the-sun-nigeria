From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja With 49 days to the general elections in Nigeria, Governor of Borno State, Babagana Zulum has boasted that his state is 90 per cent secure and safe, assuring the voting public of their safety before, during and after the elections. The governor gave the assurance after a courtesy visit to President Muhammadu Buhari, Friday, at the Presidential Villa. Borno State has, in recent times, grabbed headlines for electoral violence, with the November 2022 attack on the PDP presidential campaign train in Maiduguri, the state capital. He said: “The People of Borno State voted during the 2015 election. They also voted during the 2019 election. Can you compare the security situation in 2019 and 2015 and now? The security situation has improved tremendously by over 90 per cent, so we don’t have any problem. “Eligible voters can go and cast their votes on election day, Inshallah, in Borno State. We don’t have any problem.“ Speaking on the state of security currently, he said: “We thank that there is great improvement in terms of security in Borno State. We are doing very well now; rehabilitation and resettlement is also going very well. We are looking forward to seeing how we can rehabilitate Maiduguri, Gamborun-Gala Road and then Maiduguri-Banke Road with a view to opening up opportunities for the people to earn their means of livelihood. On the expectations of the new year, Zulum said: “We want to see how we can sustain what we are doing. So far so good in terms of security; the federal government has done well. The military has also done very well. We are now looking into the possibility of rehabilitating the victims of the insurgency. A lot of them have surrendered.
