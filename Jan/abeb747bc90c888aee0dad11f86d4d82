From Obinna Odogwu, Awka Residents of Anambra State have lamented the consistent rise in the cost of transportation within the state. They said some commercial vehicle drivers now arbitrarily increase transportation fare because of the hike in the pump price. Others argued that in addition to the increase in the price of petroleum products, especially fuel, the decrease in the number of commercial vehicles on the roads may have contributed to it. Many commercial transporters have closed business to celebrate Christmas and New Year with their families, leaving only a few vehicles on the roads. In Awka, the state capital, about a 100 percent increment in the cost of transport has been in place since the price of fuel increased. In some parts of the capital city, itâ€™s just 50 percent increment. Keke NAPEP and shuttle bus drivers now charge N100 for destinations that earlier cost N50, while those that were N100 have risen to N200. Some other routes that cost N100 now cost 150 while some routes that used to be N300 are now N500. From Awka to Onitsha that used to cost about N250 is now N500. For vehicles that have designated parks, the price remains the same even if the commuter would stop halfway. At the moment, pump price in Awka and environs is between N280 and N300 per litre depending on the location. And this situation has not really been going down well with the residents.
