From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Stakeholders in Imo State, yesterday, endorsed Governor Hope Uzodimma for a second term. The stakeholders surprised the governor with the endorsement shortly after he presented his scorecard at the 7th Imo Stakeholders Forum held in the state. Henry Njoku, during his vote of thanks passed vote of confidence on the governor and thereafter moved a motion for the governor to run for a second term. His motion was supported by the rest of the stakeholders, including elder statesmen presents who all attested that Uzodimma  deserved a second chance after achievements recorded in less than three years in office. Chairman of the Elders Council of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Chief Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu who was also at the occasion expressed happiness with the level of achievements made by Uzodimma and assured him of his support. He said: “I’ve never had a happy day like this, it’s my dream to see a prosperous Imo and Nigeria and we are near to achieving the aim. This is the first time a governor is telling us what he has done and not what he wants to do. I’ve seen  governors right from Mbakwe,I want to tell you that I haven’t seen a governor that went through such difficulties, gun men everywhere and still achieve such a great feat.” Uzodimma while reeling out his achievements on road construction, payment of salaries to workers, improvement on the Internally Generated Revenue of the state, promised to resurrect the moribund industries in the state while also vowing to expose those behind insecurity. The governor said politicians related to his government were  being attacked and asked: “Are they attacking other politicians from other parties ,help me look for the answers,our muumuu don do.” He appealed to those behind insecurity in the state to  stop and repent saying “enough is enough.”
