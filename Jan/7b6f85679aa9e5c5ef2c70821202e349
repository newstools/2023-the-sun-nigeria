From Juliana Taiwo-Obalonye, Abuja  President Muhammadu Buhari, yesterday, urged Nigerians to develop strong confidence in the country, its security institutions and never allow terrorist groups to destabilise Nigeria. The president stated this in Damaturu at the palace of the Emir of Damaturu, Hashimi II, El-Kanemi. He said his administration would continue to defend every Nigerian child’s right to education, especially those who have been uprooted by Boko Haram. “With the four months I have left as president, I’ll continue to be steadfast and I hope that I will retire in peace. We must develop strong confidence in our country. Let us make sure we do not compromise security at all in any form because security and economy are the most important things. We have gone through so much as a country and I appeal to you to be steadfast and make sure we will not allow anybody to disorganise us again,” he said. Expressing delight at the return of peace and normalcy in Yobe State and North East, the president thanked Governor Mai Mala Buni of Yobe State and his Borno State counterpart,  Babagana Zulum, for their persistence in reconstructing schools, health centres and institutions destroyed by the misguided terrorists. “There was a deliberate attempt to destroy Nigeria but God did not permit it. God has helped Nigeria to bounce back.” He also commended members of the Armed Forces and the police for their sacrifices in protecting the country.
