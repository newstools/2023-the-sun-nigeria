Former Jigawa governor, Sule Lamido,has welcomed a former deputy governor of the state, Ahmad Mahmoud, into the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Mahmoud defected from All Progressives Congress (APC) to the PDP. The former deputy governor resigned from APC last week. He was the deputy governor of Jigawa between 2007 to 2015 when Lamido was the governor of the state. Before joining the PDP, Mahmud was commissioner representing Jigawa State in the Revenue Mobilisation Allocation and Fiscal Commission (RMAFC) from where he resigned in May and contested the APC gubernatorial seat. Mahmud served and worked with Lamido from 2007 to 2015 without any problem or disagreement. Lamido, former Foreign Affairs minister used the occasion at his country home in Bamaina, Birnin Kudu Local Government Area of Jigawa State to tell the former deputy governor that PDP’s door is open to everyone, especially former members who left, especially those who held political offices either by election or appointment. Lamido also faulted former president Olusegun Obasanjo for endorsing Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi. Lamido said people like Obasanjo fail to understand that PDP made them who they are. “He is endorsing Obi because he is either angry because of Atiku Abubakar and Bola Tinubu, both men are strong characters and personalities, so the fear of these very strong men Is what is haunting him, that is all,” he said.
