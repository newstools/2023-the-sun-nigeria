Several Manchester United supporters have once again reiterated their hopes of seeing the club make a move for Napoli striker, Victor Osimhen in this year’s summer transfer window. United, who faces Charlton Athletic in a huge Carabao Cup quarter-final showdown at Old Trafford this evening is desperate to add to its attacking options this month and is currently working on a deal to sign Burnley striker, Wout Weghorst. The Reds want to sign the Dutchman on loan as a short-term fix until the end of the season. The plan is to bring in a temporary solution to their goalscoring problems before looking to invest in a big-name striker during the summer. Napoli ace, Osimhen, as reported by the Manchester Evening News exactly two months ago, is on United’s shortlist of targets and is thought to be well admired. The Nigerian international, who is under contract at the Italian giants until 2025, is the top scorer in Serie A this season, so far notching ten goals in 13 appearances. He has scored 11 goals in 16 matches in all competitions. He is widely considered as one of most promising strikers in Europe, blessed with pace, trickery and an eye for goal. He is a player that a growing number of United’s supporters have frequently highlighted as the man they would like the club to bolster their forward line with this forthcoming summer. And pleas for United to sign the 24-year-old increased further on Sunday evening after he scored again, helping Napoli seal a 2-0 away win over Sampdoria. He scored the game’s opening goal, making a brilliant run from deep and then applying a superb finish from close range. Such is his record in front of goal this season and his importance in Napoli’s quest to win Serie A this season, they would require a hefty-sized transfer fee to let him go. Nevertheless, United’s fans are desperate to see him added to Erik ten Hag’s squad.
