It was a bittersweet beginning for the Nigeria under 18 and 20 male handball teams as they played their first matches on Day 1 of the IHF Challenge Trophy Continental phase in Brazzaville, Congo. The National Under 18 team, under the tutelage of Coach Emeka Nnamani showed it was in Brazzaville for serious business as it comfortably defeated Burundi 45 â€“ 30. The National Under 20 team, however, came up short as it lost by a slim margin to Guinea 28-26 to the disappointment of Coach Fidelis Obi who is the gaffer of the side. The team has a chance of changing its fortune against Madagascar. While the under 18 team hopes to continue on its good form howbeit with a tough one against host, Congo at 3pm on Tuesday.
