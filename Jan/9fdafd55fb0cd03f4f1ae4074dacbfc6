From Okey Sampson, Umuahia All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) governorship candidate in Abia State, Gregory Ibe, has, again, debunked rumours making the rounds that he presented another person’s West Africa School Certificate (WASCE) result while submitting his expression of interest form to APGA. Two contenders for the APGA governorship seat, Chikwe Udensi and Ijioma N. Ijioma, had, during separate radio programmes monitored in Umuahia, alleged that Ibe presented false WAEC certificate to the party. However, in a statement, Ibe stated unequivocally that since he successfully completed his secondary school education in Boys High School, Ihube Okigwe and took the WASCE there in 1983, he neither needed to forge papers nor present another person’s result. “I have been told that my opponents, Udensi and Ijioma have been spreading false and wicked rumours on air about me, alleging that I presented another person’s WAEC certificate to our party.  “That is not only mischievously preposterous but also malicious since it is an established fact that I attended the reputable Boys High School, Ihube Okigwe and successfully took the WASCE in same institution in 1983.  “Therefore, I didn’t need to forge papers or present another person’s certificate since I have mine. “The fact is that I don’t know any Joseph Ibe who wrote WASCE in 1992, but I am sure my opponents, who incidentally in their separate lines of business are conversant with the standard protocols of recruitment, established processes of verification and validation of documents, impersonation and the misdemeanour of falsification, will in due course be compelled to clear the air on this heinous scheme to undo an innocent man. “My name is Gregory Ibe and it is incontrovertible that I sat for WASCE  in Boys High School, Ihube in 1983 with examination number 11510034, and my certificate is still intact,” he said.
