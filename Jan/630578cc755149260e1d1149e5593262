The Naples Public Prosecutor’s Office has reportedly requested a six-month extension for their investigation into the transfer of Victor Osimhen from Lille to Napoli. The Nigerian forward joined the Partenopei in September 2020 from the Ligue 1 outfit in a deal worth €72m, plus €10m in various add-ons. The transfer caught the attention of many at the time when it was revealed that around €20m of the deal was made up through player exchanges. La Repubblica details how the Naples Public Prosecutor’s Office wants an extra six months to carry out their investigation into the Osimhen transfer, believing the four relatively unknown players in the deal had inflated values. Prosecutor Francesco De Falco, working alongside Assistant Prosecutor Sergio Amato, believes that Napoli may have produced false communications in their financial statements for July 2020 to June 2021, based on that Osimhen transfer. Should new evidence emerge, sporting proceedings could be reopened against the Partenopei, similar to the situation Juventus is currently dealing with. Greek goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis, who was 35 at the time of the deal, was valued at around €21m alongside youth players Claudio Manzi, Luigi Liguori and Ciro Palmieri, all of whom have since left Lille.
