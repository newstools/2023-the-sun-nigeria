From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja  Atiku/Okowa Presidential Campaign Organisation has said President Muhammadu Buhari has stayed away from the campaign of the All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Bola Tinubu,  because  of alleged lack of confidence in the ability of the latter to win the February 25 polls. The campaign organisation, in a statement by its spokesperson, Kola Ologbondiyan, said it is surprised that Tinubu is talking about Integrity when there were several graft allegations against him. The campaign organisation admonished the APC candidate to stop making “empty promises, “ as the country was yet to recover from the promises made by the ruling party in 2015. “Is it not an absurdity that a presidential candidate that is beleaguered by several allegations bordering on corruption, perjury, identity theft … could muster the courage to address any gathering whatsoever on the issue of integrity. Has Asiwaju Tinubu defended the identity theft of the picture of former Governor of Cross River State, Donald Duke, which was deliberately used by his campaign organisation to portray him as a bright young man? “The Atiku/Okowa campaign says the continuous absence of President Buhari at the APC presidential campaigns showcases a concern by Mr President that Tinubu will lose a free, fair and credible poll at the February 25 presidential election. We therefore counsel Tinubu to stop dishing empty promises to Nigerians since compatriots are yet to recover from similar events which he led in the past. We urge Nigerians to continue to give their support to the leading presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the collective drive to rescue and rebuild our nation,” it said.
