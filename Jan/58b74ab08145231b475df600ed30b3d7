By Zika Bobby  Award winning author, Chimamanda Adichie at the weekend received an honorary chieftaincy title in her hometown, Abba, Anambra State.  His Royal Highness, Igwe L. N. Ezeh (Eze-Abba) conferred the “Odeluwa” title on Adichie in recognition of her contributions to the welfare of Abba community.  The Odeluwa title, which means “one who writes for the world” makes her the first woman to be conferred a chieftaincy title in her hometown of Abba.  With this title, Chimamanda officially continues the legacy of her father, Prof. James Adichie, who was until his death, the Odelu Ora Abba, meaning someone who writes for the town of Abba.  Guests at the event included Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi; Obi of Onitsha, Igwe Nnaemeka Alfred Achebe;  Governor of Anambra state, Prof. Charles Soludo; Governor of Edo State, Godwin Obaseki, among others.  This title is the latest in a long list of awards and recognitions the globally celebrated author has received from indigenous and international organisations.  In December 2022, Adichie received the Distinguished WISCAR Award at the Women in Successful Careers (WISCAR) Annual Leadership and Mentoring Conference in Lagos, Nigeria. In October 2022, she became the first African woman to receive the W.E.B Du Bois Medal, Harvard University’s highest honour in the field of African and African American studies.
