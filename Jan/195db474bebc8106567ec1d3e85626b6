West Ham United sits deep in the relegation zone and is in hot chase of a striker in the January transfer window. The 18th-placed English club, West Ham United, has placed a bid to sign Nigerian striker, Terem Moffi. According to Sky Sports, the Hammers have launched a £20 million offer with £5 million in add-ons to sign the Super Eagles attacker. It is no longer news that Moffi’s strong performance in Ligue 1 has piqued the interest of various teams. The striker, despite his club sitting in the 7th position of the French league standings, has refused to go bad with his individual efforts. The 23-year-old has now scored 12 goals, one behind Kylian Mbappé, who tops the scoring chart, and one ahead of Brazilian striker, Neymar. West Ham, who is presently suffering in the EPL standings after losing four and drawing one of their last five domestic league matches, is seeking the ideal player to strengthen their squad. Although Moffi is thought to be valued at €15 million in the market, given his recent climb to the top and many suitors, including OGC Nice, bidding approximately €18 million, it might be a tight January grab for David Moyes’s side to entice him down to England. According to rumours, the Super Eagles attacker has agreed to terms with Nice, but the club, player, or agency on the subject has made no word.
