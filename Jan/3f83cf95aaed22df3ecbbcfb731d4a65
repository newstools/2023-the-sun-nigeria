From Layi Olanrewaju, Ilorin  The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, yesterday in Ilorin, Kwara State, warned Nigerians never to be deceived into voting the opposition Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), saying a vote for PDP would be an error that would be hard to correct. According to him, several facts have pointed to the fact that the PDP presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar is only interested in the presidential race to enrich himself and his friends. He said just like he did in the past, if given the opportunity again, Atiku would only sell Nigeria to his “shady friends” in the name of privatisation. “You earned a favourable and great place in the history of our progressive party and of the nation when you voted for the APC to chase the PDP out of this beautiful and historic town. You kicked them out and now they want to come back. “Do not let them back in. They only want to devour what they could not take the first time. If you give them the chance, they will strip Kwara and Nigeria bare to the bone. “The PDP candidate in the race is well known for selling everything that has the Federal Republic of Nigeria’s name on it. If it is part of the public treasure or national patrimony, he is looking to pawn it to one of his shady partners. “He wants to sell off your chance at a decent job, good schools, a nice home and a happy life. His aim is to sell and turn our public assets into his private profit. He wants you to go hungry so that he can feast off the abundance of the land.” Tinubu also dwelt on the recent revelation by one of Atiku’s former aides, Michael Achimugu where the former vice president himself admitted to setting up Special Purpose Vehicle companies to siphon the country’s funds. “Before today, we used to call him Mr. Privatise. But today, we must give him a new name. One that comes from his own mouth.”
