By Emma Jemegah The Managing Director of Total Promotion Limited, Mr Niyi Alonge, has warned the Head of Operations of the Interim Management Company of the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL), Davidson Owumi of the consequences his action will cause the league if the IMC proceed to name a title sponsor. Mr. Alonge, in a leaked letter he personally addressed to Owunmi, he warned him to desist from disparaging his person or his company, Total Promotion. “Unless you desist from what seems like your one man driven interest that may result in embarrassing legal outcomes for league/ football, you will quickly see the house of cards you are in easily pruned to been blown off with slightest wind. Or smallest pin punch.” “You (OWUMI) instigated very false, distorted facts which you are aware of to be false needed only a simple effort to ask any of the victims, me or TPL, if for any reason you needed refreshing of the facts of the issue.  Your seemingly deliberate distortion of facts have been mind boggling and injurious to us,” he added.
