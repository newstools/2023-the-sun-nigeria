There is no gainsaying the fact that Nigerian banking legend, Otunba Olasubomi Olanipekun Balogun, is an embodiment of grace and greatness. The Founder of FCMB Group has grown to gracefully become an outstanding personality, a great phenomenon and embodiment of achievements within his immediate environment and far beyond. For the Octogenarian baron of the Nigerian capital and money markets, and man of proven immense wealth, he exudes rare altruism —sleeping, waking and thinking about how to impact positively on communities and people, especially the less privileged in his society. Indeed, he has reached an altitude in life that is shaping his attitude of gratitude to God. This his conviction to devote the rest of his life to serve God, society and do things that adds significant value to humanity has continued to wax stronger.

It’s not easy to attain the age of 89 and still be relevant in today’s banking sector. Of course, it takes a master-vision to create a masterpiece. As a pioneer and role model of entrepreneurial banking in Nigeria, Otunba Subomi is always full of gratitude to God for being the oldest and most relevant banker in Nigeria today —about two decades after retiring from active banking. The agile Octogenarian reiterated this once again last week at his annual New Year Prayer programme held at his expansive Otunba Tunwase Court, in Ijebu Ode, Ogun State. While thanking God for sparing his life, the old dandy tycoon —who has refused to retire from the hustle with no signs of slowing down as he advances in years— prayed to attain the Methuselah age of 100 and beyond by God’s grace. And those around him prayed along with him as they know Otunba Subomi lives well and healthy.
