From Scholastica Onyeka, Makurdi The National Youth Service Corps, (NYSC), has deployed a total of 1,800 Corps Members to Benue for the 2023 Batch ‘A’ orientation. The State Coordinator NYSC, Mr Abe Dankaro, who disclosed this during the swearing-in ceremony said the scheme would give priority to skills acquisition during the three weeks orientation programme. Dankaro advised corps members to take advantage of the Skill Acquisition and Entrepreneurship Development, (SAED), programme for sustainable development of their future. While cautioning that white collar jobs are not readily available, he urged them to make themselves available for the skills acquisition training saying it would offer them opportunities to be self employed after their service year. Dankaro also advised corps members against using the social media to spread fake news that would fuel hatred and disunity saying that they should deploy same for the promotion of national unity and development. He appealed to the state Governor Samuel Ortom to consider paying the corps members monthly stipends to augment their allowance to avoid massive relocation of the corps members experienced in the state in recent times. Declaring the orientation course open, Governor Samuel Ortom told the corps members to take the oath of allegiance administered to them with utmost seriousness. Ortom who spoke through the Commissioner for Youths and Sports, Mr Teryima Nguher, also informed the corps members that their security at the camp is guaranteed and advised them to do their part by shunning all social vices that might jeopardize their security. The oath taking was performed by Justice Josephine Ayua who represented the state Chief Judge, Justice Aondaver Kaka’an.
