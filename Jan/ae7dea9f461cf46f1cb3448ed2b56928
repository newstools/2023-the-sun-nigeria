There is a presence of heavy security as the Osun State election petition tribunal delivers judgment on the petition filed by Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against the declaration of Ademola Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), as the governor. Roads leading to the state high court, Ilobu road, Osogbo, were shut and heavily policed. Officials of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defense Corps (NSCDC) and policemen were heavily deployed for the judgment. Journalists, lawyers, and officials of the court were thoroughly screened while spaces were carefully allotted to reporters and lawyers. Business activities in the court were partially paralyzed as people going for a change of name and other businesses were turned back.
