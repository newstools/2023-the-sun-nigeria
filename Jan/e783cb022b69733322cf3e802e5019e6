Seven-time African champions, Flying Eagles of Nigeria will take on their Zambian counterparts in two friendly games in Abuja, Nigerian as part of preparations for this year’s Africa U20 Cup of Nations. The tour has been consummated following a request letter from the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) on January 13, and which met with the ready acceptance of the Football Association of Zambia. Through a letter dated January 14, 2023, Adrian Kashala, FAZ’s General Secretary, said the Zambia football-ruling body was agreeable to the proposal. The proposal for the tour includes FAZ flying the Junior Chipolopolo to Nigeria while the NFF will bear the cost of accommodation, feeding and other logistics for the Zambia delegation. The two matches will take place on Friday, January 27 and Monday, January 30 2023 respectively. Free-scoring Flying Eagles have scored a total of 10 goals in two friendly games since resuming camp after the yuletide period – the latest being a 5-1 mauling of Galadima FC in Abuja on Wednesday.
