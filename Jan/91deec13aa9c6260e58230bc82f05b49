Seven winners have emerged in different categories in an online competition targeting women and youths preparation in the electoral process.  The competition was organised by the WE-YOU-HAP Project led by Action Aid Nigeria.   According to Oluyemi Abodunrin, programme manager, Centre for Communication and Social Impact (CCSI), a member of the WE-YOU-HAP consortium, the competition required young people and women to upload a 60 seconds video to social media platforms detailing how they are participating in the 2023 general election at the local government level and how they are preparing for the upcoming general election using the hashtag #HopeActionProgress.   He said cash prices were given to winners as two persons emerged in the Hausa and English categories with a cash price of N100,000 each, while two others got N50,000 and N30,000 respectively and three got consolation cash prize of N10,000 each.   According to the organisers, winners were selected based on the relevance of their video to the objectives of the project on inclusion of women and young people in politics and governance; relevance to the political process preceding 2023 elections; on collection of Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs), discouraging electoral violence, addressing voters apathy, promoting good governance, and the technical quality of the videos and coherence in message delivery.
