Olopade, noted: “At last year’s race, we noticed some darkness at the starting point, which obstructed some of the opening formalities, such that we have to delay the flag off for some minutes. “That is why, for this year’s race, the official flag off time has been readjusted and rescheduled for 7am and not 6am as it used to be in previous races.” Olopade stressed that, because of the harmattan weather noticed in Lagos since the beginning of the new year, the organisers will do everything possible to make sure the weather does not affect the timing of the race. For better output and development, we must achieve a road race with a finish time in the region of 2.10 hours, which will go a long way in helping move inches close to our target of getting a Platinum Label race in the nearest future.”
