By Zika Bobby  A former chieftain of All Progressives Congress (APC), Tony Amechi, has thrown his weight behind Sheriff Oborevwori, governorship candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, (PDP) of Delta State. He said his ticket pairing him with Monday Onyeme can only be a partnership just too fitting to succeed Governor Ifeanyi Okowa. “From all nooks and crannies of Delta State and from public opinion, the Sherriff Oborevwori-Monday Onyeme ticket has been considered a ticket that has the possibilities of lifting the people of Delta in terms of sustainable development and human capital empowerment,” Amechi said. As part of Oborevwori’s selling point, the former APC chieftain said the PDP candidate has cultivated a wealth of experience in Delta politics that will enable him to thread on the path of success without political errors that may drag the state any step backwards. “One can vividly recall the giant humanitarian steps taken to cushion the effect of the lockdown made possible by COVID-19 in 2020. Oborevwori was handy; he took his humane nature down to the communities and villages; he did not only feed the people, but he also gave them a lifeline which, of course, saved the state from mass burial. “Enough foodstuffs, money and clothes were given to the elderly, poor, underprivileged, unemployed, rural and urban communities across the three senatorial districts of Delta State,” Amechi said.
