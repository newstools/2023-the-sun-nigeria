An interest group within the Labour Party (LP), Nigerians Arise (NA), has called for the sack of suspended National Publicity Secretary, Abayomi Arabambi. The group, is a statement, by its National Chairman, Eniola Arowolo, and Secretary, Hauwa Idris, accused Arabambi of gross misconduct. It lamented that despite the suspension of the party official over his role in the suspension of Doyin Okupe, former drector general of Obi-Datti Presidential Campaign Council, the suspended spokesman, has continued to work against the interest of the party. According to the group, Arabambi had since his suspension demonstrated greater mischief by inflicting more injuries on the fortunes of the party through anti-party activities. “We are forced to call for the expulsion of LP’s suspended national publicity secretary with immediate effect before he and his allies outside the party succeed in truncating the coming victory of Peter Obi and the LP. “Recall that our so-called spokesman has been a thorn in the flesh of the party by committing many sins against the LP as a member of the party’s primary committee. Whatever crisis we are facing by way of wrong substitution of candidates in Lagos and Ogun states could be traced to him and our Independent National Electoral Commission finding revealed that this was deliberate to serve certain interests outside the party. “The same Arabambi, despite holding a key position in the party had long been fraternising with the All Progressives Congress, hence we are not surprised by his actions then and now. Despite his suspension, he came out using several media to attack the LP and the appointment of our new Director General, Akin Osuntokun, as a way of disparaging the party.”
