Presidential candidate of Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, has said only good governance would resolve the problem of Nigerians living illegally in foreign countries. His media aide, Valentine Obienyem, in a statement, yesterday, quoted the LP candidate as stating this during his recent visit to the United Kingdom. “During our last visit to the UK, while Obi was discussing with a UK minister, the minister wanted to know what would be the position of Obi on Nigerians living illegally in the UK. “In replying, Obi said discussions such as that were part of the insult on Nigeria and Nigerians, which good governance would resolve finally. “He made it clear to them that most Nigerians abroad would gladly come back on their own once good governance is enthroned. “He reminded them that the duty they owe Nigeria is to support a free and fair election that would guarantee the people’s choices,” Obienyem said. According to Obienyem, the reason Nigerians were rooting for Obi is that he is so truthful and speaks to people’s hearts as one of those at the receiving end of poor governance in Nigeria. “Recall what I wrote about him, which is that each time he speaks about Nigeria, he is so plain and truthful that they affect that catharsis of emotion that even set some people crying and yearning for his success,” he said.
