By Lukman Olabiyi Nigerian youths on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC), who converged on Abeokuta, Ogun State, for their national summit, have said the endorsement of Labour Party’s Presidential candidate, Peter Obi by former President Olusegun Obasanjo was personal, saying he couldn’t dictate to them whom to vote for in the forthcoming general election. Speaking at the National Youth Summit, National Director General of APC Professionals Council,  Seyi Bamigbade said Nigeria’s democracy had gone beyond a stage where one person would determine who would become the leader, saying the former president could not play god. He said the endorsement of the Labour Party candidate by former President Obasanjo would not affect the margin of the victory of the APC Presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, who he said, would secure landslide victory at the polls next month Bamigbade accused the former of expressing frustration over his inability to control the current government. He said Asiwaju Bola Tinubu enjoys wide acceptance from the Nigerian young population as clearly indicated in the mammoth crowd that besieges the party’s rallies across the states. Earlier, the National President of Concerned Youths Electoral Credibility (CYEC),  Paul Chinonso, said the action of the former president fell short of a statesman, insisting that they would vote for APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the next month’s presidential election.
