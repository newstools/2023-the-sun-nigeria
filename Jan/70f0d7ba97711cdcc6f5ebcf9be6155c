Manchester United’s Premier League clash against Bournemouth is set to broadcast live on DStv and GOtv. Customers can tune in to SuperSport Football (GOtv channel 31) at 8:50pm tonight to enjoy the Old Trafford game. “We have the advantage of requesting today an independent inspection visit no later than January 06, 2023, to assess the current state of the stadium at the end of the rehabilitation works carried out by the Province of Haut Katanga to obtain approval for CAF matches and competitions,” the statement said. Erik Ten hag’s team have bounced back from their sloppy start to the season and they climbed fourth on the league table after they defeated Wolves by a lone goal on New Year’s Eve. Reacting to the win at the post-match press briefing, Ten Hag said, “We made a good step today, it is the first time we’ve made the top-four but it means nothing.  “There is a long way to go, we have to live from game to game. You can win something this season, that is what we are aiming for, but it demands hard work.” The Red Devils, buoyed by an in-form Marcus Rashford, will be keen to secure victory against an opponent that has lost eight of their nine away games at Old Trafford in all competitions. However, Ten Hag will also be wary of his team’s recent poor home record in January games. Manchester United have lost three of their last five home Premier League games in January. Other Premier League games to watch include the mid table duel between Fulham and Leicester City at the Kingpower Stadium. This will air live on SuperSport La Liga (GOtv channel 32) at 8:35pm tonight, while the Leeds United and Westham United game will air on SuperSport Football (GOtv channel 31) at 8:35pm tomorrow.
