Constitutional lawyer, Peter  Abang, has petitioned the Attorney General of the Federation (AGF) and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami (SAN), seeking commencement of criminal inquiry, arrest and prosecution of the Director General of State Security Services (SSS), Yusuf Magaji Bichi, over his alleged role in the foiled plot to frame CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, for terrorism financing. The lawyer’s petition was sequel to the Courts’ clearance of the CBN Governor, which described the plot as baseless and oppressive. In the petition dated December 30, 2022 and addressed to the AGF, the lawyer sought for a full-scale criminal inquiry into the circumstances Ieading to the failed attempt by the State Security Services (otherwise known as the Department of State Services) to frame the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on allegations and trumped-up terrorism financing charges as well as other sundry offences. According to him, the letter to the AGF serves as a notice to commence an action for mandamus to compel AGF offices to arrest and prosecute all persons and/or parties who were connected in the event he fails at acceding to the request within seven days. The petition reads, “In view of the above suit filed by the State Security Services, which the Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, the Hon. Justice John Tsoho, delivered its ruling on December 9, 2022 , a certified copy of the Ruling is attached and we are by this letter respectfully requesting that your good offices commence a full scale criminal inquiry into the circumstances Ieading to the failed attempt by the State Security Services (otherwise known as the Department of State Services) to frame the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on allegations and trumped up terrorism financing charges as well as other sundry offences. We also request that your offices conduct a thorough investigation and ultimately arrest and prosecute all persons and/or parties connected to the failed rogue operation in the overall interest of Nigeria. “Note that this letter serves as a notice to commence an action for mandamus to compel your offices to arrest and prosecute all persons and/or parties who are connected in the event that you fail at accede to our request within 7 days from the date of service of this letter to you.”
