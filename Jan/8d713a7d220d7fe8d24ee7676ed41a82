The result makes it two wins in two matches for the side that hosts Lobi Stars of Makurdi on Saturday, also in Umuahia. Fellow Abia State team, Enyimba of Aba that began the season also with an away win against Nasarawa United could not consolidate on its turf as Akwa United battled to a scoreless draw in Aba.
