Former two division champion David Haye expects Anthony Joshua to pull off an impressive, dominant win in a planned fight against heavyweight contender Jermaine Franklin. Joshua, who is looking to bounce back after losing consecutive fights to Oleksandr Usyk, is scheduled to return on April 1 at the O2 Arena in London. Franklin put forth an impressive performance back in November, when he lost a twelve round split decision to Dillian Whyte. There were many observers who felt Franklin had done enough to win. Joshua, a former two-time heavyweight champion, needs to look good in order to position himself for major fights. Haye believes Joshua needs to rethink his in-ring strategy if he’s not capable of stopping Frankin in a handful of rounds. “He should beat Jermaine Franklin. It was a good fight he gave Dillian Whyte, so he’s shown he has some skills, he’s shown he’s got a nice jab and some good head movement,” Haye told Pro Boxing Fans. “But if AJ can’t blast him out of there in three or four rounds, then he’s doing something wrong. He’s so much bigger and stronger, so much more athletic and punches so much harder – and he’s an Olympic gold medalist. So, he’s got everything in his favor, he just needs to go out there and let his hands go. “If he goes out there and tries to have a boxing match with him then he will have a hard time because the guy is quite a tricky little boxer.” Eddie Hearn, promoter for Joshua, recently praised Franklin – explaining that he wasn’t sure why some observers were critical of the fight. “I don’t understand what more people want. He’s coming back, working with a new trainer and getting a foothold in the heavyweight division.  Jermaine Franklin is a dangerous fight, he’s full of confidence and coming off a great performance against Dillian Whyte,” Hearn said.
