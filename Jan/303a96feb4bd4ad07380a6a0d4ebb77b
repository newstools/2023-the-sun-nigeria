The Labour Party (LP) on Friday said that the likelihood that about 3.5 million students may not participate in the polls due to inability to get their Permanent Voters Cards (PVCs) because they are in school, was a calculated attempt to deny the party its due votes in the forthcoming general elections.  The LP’ National Youth Leader, Prince Ahanotu, who stated this at a press briefing in Abuja, called for an extension of the deadline for collection of the PVCs.  He also demanded that students in higher institutions be given a one-week holiday to enable them go home and collect their PVCs.  It has been reported that no fewer than 3.5 million students who registered for the general elections and whose polling units are sited in states outside their campuses, may be unable to exercise their franchise. This is because they wouldn’t be able to get to their polling places during the election because they would be stuck on their respective campuses.  Ahanotu said: “Nigerian students cum youths across the country have gone through tough and rough times over the years as a result of bad leadership, hence the need to advocate strongly for youths participation in the coming general election to enable them take part in deciding their destiny going forward.  “Today the Youths in Nigeria want to take part in taking back their country from those who have mismanaged our resources by contribut- ing towards the New Nigeria agenda via the ballot, and  they must not be disfranchised as many believe that a better Nigeria is possible with Mr Peter Obi and Sen. Datti Baba-Ahmed.  “We call on the Federal Government, Academic Staff Union of Universi- ties (ASUU), Academic Staff Union of Polytechnics (ASUP), National University Commission (NUC), state governments and other private university owners to give one week holiday for students in higher institutions to go home and collect their PVCs.”
