From Joe Effiong, Uyo Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) gubernatorial candidate in Akwa Ibom State, Pastor Umo Eno, has expressed his surprise at a news of his incarceration and warrant of arrest by an Abuja Magistrate’s Court in a supposedly civil case which proceedings he was never served. Edet Godwin Etim said to have been a former worker in Umo Eno’s company is said to have lodged a complaint against the candidate at a Magistrate’s Court, Wuse Abuja, on issue of ‘cheating’, leading the court to commence criminal proceedings against the candidate and eventually convicted him before issuing a warrant of arrest. The court claimed that Eno had ‘refused to surrender himself to the court’. But speaking at his campaign rally in Ika council recently, Eno said he was not aware of any such court case as he was never served any of its proceedings. And, as such, it was strange how he could have responded to a case he was never aware of. Umo Eno advised the public to ignore what they read about the case because it was a mere fabrication. Daily Sun, however, gathered that the Abuja Customary’s Court actually issued the warrant of arrest against Eno even though he was not served any summon on the case. It was learned Eno’s legal team has commenced proceedings to ensure the ‘fraudulent warrant’ is not only set aside by the proper judiciary investigation is carried out to ensure why a supposedly civil case, in which the supposedly respondent was not served any summon, could be clandestinely decided in Abuja, when the alleged infraction was said have been committed in Akwa Ibom State.
