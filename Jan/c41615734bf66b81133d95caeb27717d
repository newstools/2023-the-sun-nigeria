The Police man who allegedly killed a female Lawyer on Christmas day in Lagos said he is not guilty of the offence. The policeman, Drambi Vandi was arraigned before a Lagos State High Court on Monday where he pleaded not guilty of the murder of Mrs Bolanle Raheem. However at the commencement of trial, a witness gave the Lagos state High Court, graphic details of how an Assistant Superintendent of Police (ASP) Mr. Drambi Vandi allegedly killed a female lawyer, Bolanle Raheem during the the Christmas season. The witness, a Inspector of Police identified as Matthew Ahmen, who said he is a colleague of Drambi Vandi, who allegedly killed female lawyer told the High Court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square on Monday that they were conducting a stop and search when the incident happened. He said Vandi who was the leader of their team was behind while he was in the middle, and another colleague, Inspector Dimini, was in the front. Ahmen who was the first prosecution witness said when Dimini saw a car coming, he flagged it down but the car didn’t stop, and when the car got to where he was standing, he also flagged the car down but the car didn’t stop as well. He said: “The next thing I heard was a gunshot and I looked back to see what was happening and I saw that a windscreen was falling. “The next thing I saw again was a dark woman who jumped down from the vehicle and I heard her saying that ‘oga you have killed my sister.’ The woman held him and before I and Dimini could get to them, they had entered the car, locked it, and left.”
