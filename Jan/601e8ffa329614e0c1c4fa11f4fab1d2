Super Eagles striker Victor Osimhen has received plaudits from Romelu Lukaku, with the Chelsea loanee labeling him as the best player in the Italian Serie A ahead of the clash between Inter and Napoli on Wednesday at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza. The Serie A returns after the break occasioned by the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar with Inter keen to wrestle the leadership of the Serie A from Osimhen’s Napoli. “Napoli have a really strong coach, they are doing a great job, they have a lot of great players. They are in a good moment, they have Osimhen who scores a lot of goals, (Khvicha) Kvaratskhelia who is very strong,” Lukaku noted in an interview with Sky Sports Italia, via FCInterNews. “He (Osimhen) is really strong, he is the best now. We have to be honest, he’s doing really well and Napoli are first in the table. We have respect but not fear,” Lukaku noted. Osimhen has scored nine league goals in 11 games  chalking up a total of 904 minutes of football while Lukaku only has one goal in four league games. Lukaku has won 104 caps for the Belgian national team, scoring 68 goals to become his country’s all-time top scorer.
