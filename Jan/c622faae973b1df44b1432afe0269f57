Arrangements are in top gear for three players of one of the top notch grassroots football academy in the country, Blue Ocean Football Club with base in Abuja and Ado-Ekiti, Ekiti State to join FC Braila, a third division outfit in Romania. The players are Godwin Festus Udoka, Dedan Koko Ejieroghene and goalkeeper Jacob Daniel Abah An official of the club told our correspondent on phone “No players are better than this one. They are the future of football in the country. I can tell you that they can easily replace the likes of Okocha, Kanu or Osimhen. It’s just a matter of time” “The skills that the boys have displayed so far are amazing. Their pace is unbelievable and of course they have a very good age. Festus, who is a defensive midfielder that can easily replace Wilfred Ndidi in the Super Eagles, was born in January 2002 while Dedan, who can play either as central defender or defensive midfielder, is in a class of its own. The players who are in the final stage of preparation for the trip are expected to storm the Embassy to secure their visa before jetting out of the country. All the contractual arrangements are been finalised by top officials of the Academy, the Nigeria Football Federation and the Romania club. Blue Ocean Academy has been going places since its establishment few years ago and churning out talented and exciting footballers.
