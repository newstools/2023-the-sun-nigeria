By Chukwudi Nweje Imo State Government, yesterday, absolved itself from the inferno that engulfed parts of the residence of spokesman of the Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere. In said Ugochinyere does not pose any threat to the state to warrant any form of attention by the government. A statement by Imo State Commissioner for Information and Strategy, Declan Emelumba described the CUPP spokesman as a queer and perverted individual with track record of “cantankerous conduct,” and who  “picks enemies the way magnet picks pin and therefore should look inward to know where his problem emanated.” The commissioner said Ugochinyere has lived a life of falsehood and violence, and was afraid of his shadow. He, however, called on security agencies to investigate the arson with a view to establishing the culprits. He said: “Imo State Governor, Senator Hope Uzodimma has been in politics for more than 40 years and has never been linked to any kind of violence. Ugochinyere is so inconsequential with microscopic importance in the political firmament of the state to warrant any attention, not to talk of torching his house. It is unfortunate and pathetic that in his quest for attention, Ugochinyere does not hesitate to drag the state government into his habitual, messy, tissue of lies. A man who is at loggerhead with his party national chairman, a man who is working with anti-democratic forces to cancel the upcoming elections and a man at loggerhead with some of his kinsman should know when nemesis is after him and stop crying wolf. His ordeal is certainly not from Imo State Government. From the so called Omuma voters register magic to all his insults on the governor and the current one, all of them are mere falsehood aimed at attracting undue attention to himself.” The commissioner berated the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), which it said had been silent throughout the orgy of violence that pervaded the state
