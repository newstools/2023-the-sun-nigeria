It also announced the devolving of PVCs collection to the 8,809 Registration Areas/Wards from today to Sunday, January 15, 2023. The information was contained in a statement signed by National Commissioner and Chairman Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, and made available to newsmen in Abuja. “All those that applied for replacement of lost, damaged, or defaced PVCs can collect their PVCs at the Registration Area/wards during this period and the same thing applies to those that registered prior to the 2019 general election and are yet to collect their cards. “The commission held its regular weekly meeting and deliberated on several issues, including the venue for the National Situation Room and Collation Centre for the 2023 General Election. “As general elections approach, the commission establishes a National Situation Room and Collation Centre where the results of presidential elections are collated. Once again, the International Conference Centre (ICC) in Abuja will serve as the venue for this important exercise,” it added.
