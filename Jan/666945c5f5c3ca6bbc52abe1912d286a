Billionaire auto magnate and Chairman of Skymit Group, Tayo Ayeni is a man whose ingenuity and industry have seen him grow from just being an entrepreneur with interest in a particular business to becoming a respected and renowned empire builder. Unlike some affluent entrepreneurs who live to sing the song of their own deeds, he remains impressively humble and not given to any crass extravagance. This rare path has attracted him to honour in torrents home and abroad. Aside from his tested and trusted business sense, he’s also known to be one who goes all out whenever he has a reason to celebrate as he is famed for throwing some of the best parties in Lagos. The last time was in May 2022 when Ayeni got hundreds of dignitaries from all over the country including top politicians, business moguls, CEOs, technocrats and royals into Lagos, as his beloved daughter, Mathilda Gbemisola got married to the love of her life, Olamide Akintayo. Seven months later, Ayeni went all out to roll out the carpets to play host to the creme de la creme of the society on Wednesday, December 29, 2022 when he clocked 60. The businessman and his gorgeous wife, Adetutu, feted their select high net worth guests at a 3-in-1 diamond celebration in Lagos. It started off with a thanksgiving service at the Church of Nativity, Anglican Communion, Ikoyi, Lagos. This was followed by a brunch at his Banana Island mansion where guests were serenaded by the choir of Pastor Ituah Ighodalo’s Trinity House Church, and it climaxed by an extravagant soiree thrown in his honour at the Oriental Hotel, Lagos.
