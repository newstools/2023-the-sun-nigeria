From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has said no amount of speculation and unprofitable media talks by people will make him change his mind on the presidential candidate to support. He stated this, yesterday,  at Egbeda Community while flagging off the construction of Akpabu-Egbeda-Omoku Link Road  in Emohua Local Government Area. He said: “If anybody say what you want to say that I am working for so and so person, it’s their business; say that I am not working for so and so person, it’s their business. That will not make me change my mind where we are heading to. Do you understand me? So, if they like, they can make speculations. After All, that is why the word, speculation is there. Some of them who do not have 25 votes are busy abusing leaders. When you are finished abusing leaders, you will pay. We are here talking to our people, they are there in radio stations and television houses. We are here talking to our people. When you are finished, by that time, it’ll be too late.” The Rivers State governor thanked the people of Egbeda community for supporting his administration since 2015. Governor Wike informed that he had long promised one of their sons, David Omereji, to bring democratic dividend to his community. The Akpabu-Egbeda-Elele- Omoku link road  being flagged off, he said, is one of such promises he made to them and for which he was fulfiling. He flayed former  governor of Rivers State, Chibuike Amaechi, whose mother hails from Egbeda Community  for not doing something for the community.
