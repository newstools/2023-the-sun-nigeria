…suspects name bank officials From Molly Kilete, Abuja The Department of State Services (DSS), has announced the arrest of some suspected syndicates engaged in the selling of the new redesigned Naira notes to desperate members of the public. The suspects arrested in various parts of the country were said to have fingered some Commercial Bank officials as being behind their illegal operations. DSS Public Relations Officer Peter Afunanya, who made this known, said that the Service has ordered its Commands and Formations to further ensure that all persons and groups engaged in the illegal sale of the notes are identified and arrested. Afunaya, in a statement said “The Department of State Services (DSS) hereby informs the public that it has intercepted some members of organised syndicates involved in the sale of the new redesigned naira notes. In the course of its operations, in this regard in parts of the country, it was also established that some Commercial Bank officials are aiding the economic malfeasance. “Consequently, the Service warns the currency racketeers to desist from this ignoble act. Appropriate regulatory authorities are, in this same vein, urged to step up monitoring and supervisory activities to expeditiously address the emerging trends. “It should be noted that the Service has ordered its Commands and Formations to further ensure that all persons and groups engaged in the illegal sale of the notes are identified. Therefore, anyone with useful information relating to this is encouraged to pass the same to the relevant authorities”.
