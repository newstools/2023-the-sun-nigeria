From Paul Osuyi, Asaba Four suspects who specialised in defrauding victims of their hard earned money have told police investigators how they carry out their nefarious activities. The all male suspects include Allison Louis (27) from Adamawa State, Sunday David (22) from Benue State, Peter Akagbai (20) and Chibuzor Elumeze (23) both from Ogwashi-Uku in Aniocha South Local Government Area of Delta State. A statement by the Public Relations Officer of the command, DSP Bright Edafe, said the suspects have been operating at POS spots, supermarkets and filling stations in Ogwashi-Uku and Asaba. “The suspects stated that they go to filling stations, POS operators and super markets, purchase items and also make withdrawals with the ATM cards and then call their banks and give a false complaint that the transaction was not successful. “The banks without due investigation will then wrongly debit the victims and credit the accounts of the suspects. They have so far defrauded their various victims several millions of naira,” Edafe stated. Edafe said the suspects were arrested by the Decoy Squad of the command following credible intelligence, adding that one tricycle, and 15 assorted bank ATM cards were recovered. He also confirmed the arrest of a suspected cultist and alleged financier of the Aro Bagger cult group, 37-year old Joseph Ologbo in Sapele area of the state. Edafe said a combined team of the Command Special Anti-Cult Unit (SACU), operatives of the Department of State Service (DSS) and men of Operation Delta Hawk, stormed the hotel where the suspect was hibernating and arrested him. “When search was extended to his fully tinted Toyota Tundra Van, one unlicensed pump action gun, two live cartridges, one expended cartridge, and an Aro Bagger cult regalia were recovered. “The suspect has made useful statement and will be charged to court upon completion of the investigation,” he added.
