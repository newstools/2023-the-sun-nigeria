It is obvious that all things are brighter and beautiful for the debonair businessman and the CEO of TILT Group of Companies Limited, Chief Habeeb Olalekan Okunola. Since he voyaged into the business terrain, Okunola has been a shining light, capping years of experience with discipline and doggedness. The young businessman, a University of Lagos Philosophy graduate, is not carried away by frivolities. In his young age, while most of his fellow silver spoon kids were busy leeching on the stupendous wealth of their parents, Okunola, organically, was building his personal business empire. Today, he has formidably turned his small seed into a multi-billion naira conglomerate with imprints in real estate, oil and gas, technology, agriculture, and engineering. That Okunola has come so far in life in such a short time can only be grace, after all. And he recognises that. With proceeds from his business dealings, the young magnate has devoted substantial part of the wealth —through his Habeeb Okunola Foundation— to lifting many by providing succour to the downtrodden and giving a lifeline to many who have lost hope across the country and in Benin Republic where he also owns businesses. His business achievement and good nature have equally attracted him honours and recognition from the high and mighty including the title of Akosin of Yorubaland bestowed on him by the late Alaafin of Oyo, Oba Lamidi Adeyemi in 2021. He capped the recognition with the national honour of the Member of the Order of Niger, MON by President Muhammadu Buhari late last year. In appreciation of all these numerous achievements, Okunola, once again during the recent yuletide season, spread happiness to over 1,000 vulnerable households across Nigeria. The business czar extended his magnanimous nature to aged women, widows and other vulnerable individuals with loads of food items, mosquito nets and lots more as well as educational materials to pupils and students as they resumed from the holidays.
