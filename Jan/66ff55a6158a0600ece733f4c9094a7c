According to Edafe, the victim was kidnapped on December 11, 2022, and held hostage at a hotel in Iwherekpokpor community, Ughelli North LGA where they took her nude pictures, and recorded her on video while inserting a candle in her private part. He said the suspects used the same video to blackmail the victim and her parents to pay huge ransom. Edafe, said, following the report, the police in conjunction with Ekiugbo  community vigilante, arrested one Cornelius Emene, 32. “During preliminary investigation, the suspect made useful statement that led to the arrest of two other suspects:Nelson Aghogho (aka Little), Ufuoma Tunde (lady), and also gave account of how they kidnapped another student of School of Health and Technology, Ofuoma. “The modus operandi of the syndicate is to lure unsuspecting young girls on facebook, get them to a hotel, drug them, gang rape them, before holding them hostage and demand ransom from their parents to secure their release. “The suspects’ phones contained numerous sex video recording of their previous victims, which was also used to blackmail them and their parents. “The three suspects, Cornelius Ememah, Nelson Aghogho (aka Little), and Ofuoma Tunde are currently in custody, and investigation is ongoing,” he stated.
