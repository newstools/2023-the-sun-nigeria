From Tony John, Port Harcourt Rivers State governor, Nyesom Wike, has said approval has been given to Presidential Campaign Council (PCC) of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to use the Adokiye Amiesimaka Stadium for campaign of the party’s presidential candidate, Atiku Abubakar, in the state. The governor, however, explained that the approval granted at no cost to the Presidential Campaign Council, is that the stadium would be accessible to the council 48 hours to the February 11, 2023, presidential campaign. Governor Wike disclosed this while speaking at the campaign flag-off rally by the Rivers State PDP Campaign Council in Oyigbo Local Government Area on Friday. He said the Director-General of the PCC in Rivers State,  Abiye Sekibo, has no right to want to take possession of the stadium one month before the date of the stipulated event. Wike warned Sekibo not to provoke the Rivers State government by desperately wanting to take possession of the state-owned stadium weeks to the campaign, or else the approval would be cancelled. Governor Wike, however, said by the approval he signed, Sekibo and his group could only begin to access the stadium two days to the event to verify and put in place what they required for their rally. Governor Wike also took a swipe at the All Progressives Congress (APC) in Rivers State for the crisis that greeted the campaign of its governorship candidate in Mile One Diobu, Port Harcourt, on Thursday. The governor stressed that the APC governorship candidate, Tonye Cole,  in collusion with the immediate past administration of Governor Chibuike Amaechi, sold the state gas turbines and diverted $50 million from the state account. He said the APC governorship candidate is now facing criminal charges with the state government demanding from him the refund of the  $50 million, which it wants to use for development projects.
