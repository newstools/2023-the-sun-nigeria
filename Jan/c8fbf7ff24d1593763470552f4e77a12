From Ogbonnaya Ndukwe, Aba Abia State governor,  Dr Okezie Ikpeazu, has promised residents of the industrial city of Aba of more government presence in the area if he is voted in as a member of the National Assembly in the forthcoming elections. Ikpeazu, who is vying for the Abia South Senatorial seat, was in the area with his team on Thursday and Friday, where he campaigned in wards across Aba South and Aba North, where he commended the people, for supporting his administration these past seven and a half years. He said he was able to build some infrastructure which among them, was the rehabilitation of roads, educational and health facilities. But, speaking in the local Ngwa dialect, he said he realized the need to do more, hence the quest to go to the Senate, to attract more development projects to the commercial city for the good of its people. “My government has tried it’s best in improving lot of the people of Aba by building many roads that were impassable, upgrading infrastructure but I realized that we have not done enough. “If you vote for me and our party, the PDP, into office in the elections, we will do more. I will attract federal presence and development projects to Aba, to make you feel better,” he promised. Ikpeazu, chided those he said had gone to the National Assembly, to sleep, argue and quarrel with people, while abandoning the people they had gone to represent to suffer, and promised that if elected in the February 25th, elections, he would not leave them to their fate.
