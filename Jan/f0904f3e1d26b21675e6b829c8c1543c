Abia State chapter of the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) unanimously adopted Bishop Sunday Ndukwo Onuoha, the governorship candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC) as their consensus candidate in the governorship election holding in March. This is coming at a time when anxiety has gripped members of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Abia State as the Court of Appeal, Owerri Division today delivers judgement in an appeal filed by Sampson Uka Orji against PDP, the party’s governorship candidate, Prof Uche Ikonne and Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC). The CAN adoption of Bishop Onuoha was made after the ADC candidate addressed the Christian organisation’s leaders at their consultation meeting held at Umuahia. Bishop Onuoha, who was grilled for over an hour by the CAN local government coordinators and state officers took time to satisfactorily answer every question and gave every assurance of participatory governance, godly and righteous leadership to change the narrative of Abia. Speaking at the meeting, the Chairman of CAN, Abia State, Apostle General Emmanuel Agomdi, urged the CAN leaders to take the message down to their local government areas and communities. Bishop Sunday Onuoha thanked the Christian body for the reception and his adoption, promising never to let the Church down. In another development, Abia PDP governorship candidate will today know his fate as the Court of Appeals delivers judgement in a suit challenging his selection. Orji had, in Suit No FHC/UM/CS/111/2022, challenged the judgement of Justice Evelyn Anyadike of the Federal High Court, Umuahia delivered on November 30, 2022. The Court of Appeal adjourned for judgement after parties had presented their briefs of appeal and arguments. Orji’s appeal is founded and predicated on 11 grounds.
