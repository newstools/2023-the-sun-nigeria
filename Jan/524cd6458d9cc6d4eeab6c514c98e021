From Isaac Anumihe, Abuja The Federal Government has directed that the   Second Niger Bridge should  remain closed to the public use with effect from Sunday, January 15, 2023 for the continuation of work on the completion of the access roads to the bridge. Similarly, it directed  contractors on major highways to restore all barricades at the sites mounted during the Yuletide season. Giving the directive,  Minister of Works and Housing, Mr Babatunde Fashola, sought  the patience and understanding of motorists and members of the public. According to him, the action is aimed at completing the on-going projects. In a statement, the Permanent Secretary of the ministry, Engineer Folorunso Esan said  that the affected  highways include,  Lagos-Ibadan Expressway (from OPIC to the old toll-gate) and the Abuja-Kaduna-Kano Expressway (around Kawo on the Kaduna-Zaria Section). The barricades were removed at all construction sites on December 15, 2022 for ease of movements  to reduce travel time during the Yuletide season. On completion, the bridge,  alongside other federal highways, may be tolled. So far, 11 construction firms have indicated interests  to manage and toll 12 selected highways across the nation. The concessionaires (firms) will assume the responsibilities to develop and manage their respective highways for an agreed period of time, including the economic rights over all revenue-generating commercial activities from the Highway Economy along the Right of Way.
