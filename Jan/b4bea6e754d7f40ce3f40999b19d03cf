From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC), has dismissed the report claiming that the governor of Kogi State, Yahaya Bello, has withdrawn his support for the party’s presidential candidate, Bola Ahmed Tinubu. Describing it as irresponsible, the ruling party said that the story is “maliciously false and a figment of the imagination of it’s author and sponsors.” The statement signed by the APC National Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, also claimed that the mischievous story was intended to clash Governor Bello and James Faleke, Secretary of the APC PCC. “Governor Bello who serves as the National Youth Coordinator of the Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), is a solid, resourceful and committed campaigner for our party’s candidate, leading a massively successful outreach to youth voters across the country. “This FAKE NEWS, ostensibly intended to float an imagined rift between Governor Bello and James Faleke, Secretary of the APC PCC, is the desperate and disgraceful conjecture of opposition elements unsettled by our party’s giant campaign strides. “Both loyal party men are unquestionably committed and working tirelessly for the resounding victory of Bola Tinubu in next month’s presidential election. We urge our party compatriots and all Nigerians to disregard this fake news,” the statement read.
