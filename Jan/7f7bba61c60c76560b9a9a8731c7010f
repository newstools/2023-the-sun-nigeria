Oni also claimed that the tenure of Buni as National Caretaker Chairman had expired at the time he signed the nomination forms. Oni also stated in the petition that the deputy governorship candidate, Mrs Monisade Afuye submitted fake WAEC results and certificates to the INEC to contest the election. No date has been fixed for the hearing of the appeal.
