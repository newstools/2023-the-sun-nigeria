By Henry Uche A former president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo has affirmed that the next president of Nigeria must be a man or woman who is morally, mentally and physically sound, and has the fear of God, to be able to pilot the affairs of the country progressively. The former president, who spoke on Thursday at a virtual session put together by Africa Leadership Group (Africa Leadership Series), with the theme “Leadership and nation-building,” asserted that some political candidates did not know the content of their manifestos, evidenced in the blame game of the current administration.  Contrary to the belief by many Nigerians that their votes would not count, Obasanjo assured eligible voters that, this time, their votes would count in the forthcoming general elections. He urged them to pick up their Permanent Voter Cards (PVC). Obasanjo bemoaned that the country had been in a sorrowful state, therefore, needed a leader that is physically, mentally and clinically sound with the right character, skills, attitude and attributes to turn things around positively. “I hope the man who will be the next president will be the type of leader who will understand the diversity and economic management and administration,” he said. He also decried the level of insecurity, crude oil theft and other malfeasances ravaging the country, noting that the next Nigeria president must be bold enough to confront the aforementioned and other multilayered anomalies besetting the country. He called for political education for every Nigerian saying, “It doesn’t matter if you’re well educated with different degrees. Many Nigerians do not have political education. We are easily carried away by ethnicity; religion and many other irrelevant issues unfortunately.”
