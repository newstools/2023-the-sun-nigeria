From Magnus Eze, Gombe All Progressives Congress (APC) in Enugu has set up a five-man disciplinary committee to investigate alleged anti-party activities levelled against former Senate president, Ken Nnamani, and two other members of the party in the state. Briefing newsmen after a meeting of the state executive committee in Enugu, yesterday, Secretary of the party, Robert Ngwu, accused the party chieftain of openly campaigning for the Enugu State governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Peter Mbah. Other party members expected to appear before the disciplinary committee alongside Nnamani are a former commissioner for Culture and Tourism in the state, Joe Mmamel and Maduka Arum. The party alleged that those allegedly destabilising the party were being sponsored from within and outside the APC. “They were financed with N20 million of tax payers’ money to lead PDP members to APC national headquarters in Abuja to lay false claims of non-existent financial fraud of N1.3 billion against Uche Nnaji, our governorship candidate, and Ugochukwu Agballah. “Apart from Nnamani, the party has also received petitions against Ozor Joe Mmamel and Maduka Arum from Ezeagu Local Government Area and Enugu South Local Government Area respectively, all bordering on anti-party. “The state executive committee of the party has, therefore, forwarded all the petitions, and the fact-finding reports to the state disciplinary committee for investigation and recommendation of appropriate sanctions. The party will not hesitate to suspend or expel the accused, if found guilty by the Disciplinary Committee,” the party said.
