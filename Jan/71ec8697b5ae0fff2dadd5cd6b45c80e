From Lateef Dada, Osogbo   The All Progressives Congress (APC) youth leaders in 332 wards of Osun State have embarked on a door-to-door campaign to mobilise youths and students for the presidential candidate of the party, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, and his running mate, Kashim Shettima. Addressing the youths at the Tinubu/Shettima campaign office in Osogbo yesterday, David Asalu, the Chairman of the Directorate of Youth and Student Mobilisation of the APC Presidential Campaign Council, Osun State, said the youths were striving to ensure that Osun contributes a significant amount to the pool of votes that will make Tinubu president. He said: “Understanding that youths and students form a large and critical percentage of the voting population, we as a directorate are aware of the enormity of the task ahead of us, and are, therefore, committing all of our capacity to ensuring that we interface with ever youth group, youth organisation or youth stakeholder anywhere they may be in the state. Asalu explained that the youths are out to let people know that Tinubu had proved his political mettle over the years and had shown beyond misconception, that he would run a Federal Government that would deliver good dividends of democracy to the people. The Secretary of the Directorate, Demola Adeyeye, explained that the meeting was to review the activities of the Directorate with relevant stakeholders to improve its relationship with the youth population in the state ahead of the general elections.
