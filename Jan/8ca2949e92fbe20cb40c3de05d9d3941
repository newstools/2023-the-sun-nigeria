Farmers in Bauchi State have called on the Federal Government  to check  fake and substandard production  of fertiliser. Some of the farmers on Tuesday, urged government to issue sales permit to operators. Alhaji Babayo Ibrahim, a rice farmer in Bauchi, said some plants in the country were blending without proper authorisation and mixing substandard components to produce adulterated fertiliser. Ibrahim said that some merchants, engaged in the fertiliser business, are not fully registered as required by the national fertiliser quality control law. He called on government to get rid of adulterated fertiliser from the market and to ensure that no firm produces fertiliser without government’s approval. Mrs Fatima Abdu-Misau, Treasurer, Small Scale Women Farmers of Nigeria (SWOFON), attributed the scarcity of  raw materials to  the high cost of the fertiliser. She urged the Federal Government to source the two important raw materials locally through the Solid Mineral Development Fund to guide against future scarcity. Abdu-Misua, called on the Federal Government to address the challenges to enhance food production and food security challenges in the country. Mr Samuel Luka, a farmer said substandard fertiliser and the increase in prices of fertilisers in the country, was  affecting farmers, hence the need to support them. “There is need for smallholder farmers to be provided with free bags of  fertiliser in a package to effectively reduce their fertiliser cost per acre by at least 33.3 per cent,“he said. He said that government must ensure that farmers have access to enough fertiliser to in order sustain food production in. Luka appealed to government and international fertiliser producers, to make a commitment to the provision of fertilizers.
