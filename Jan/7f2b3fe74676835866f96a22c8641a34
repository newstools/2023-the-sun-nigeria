By Emma Njoku  Delta State House of Assembly Speaker and governorship candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Francis Oborevwori, has been honoured by the Church of Nigeria, Anglican Communion, for his services to humanity. The award was presented to Oborevwori by The Bishop of the Diocese of Warri of the Ecclesiastical Province of Bendel, Christian Esezi Ide, at yesterday’s service at St Stephen’s Anglican Church, Effurun. The ceremony drew the attendance of various Anglican bishops across the province and Diocese, including John Aruakpor, bishop of Oleh Diocese. The bishop said the Episcopal award was in recognition of Oborevwori’s “numerous laudable contributions to the growth of the Church and humanity.” An elated Oborevwori said he was humbled by the unexpected honour and promised to do more for the good of the society, “in furtherance of our common humanity and to the glory of God.”
