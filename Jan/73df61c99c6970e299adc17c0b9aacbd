By Moses Akaigwe Mikano International’s Motors Division seems to have formed the habit of keeping the identity of a new auto brand or model under wraps and sustaining the suspense with teasers until the launch date.  About 10 months after teasing the market ahead of the grand unveiling of the “game-changer” called  Geely Azkarra in March, 2022, the fastest growing automotive company in Nigeria is set to expand its portfolio with a new brand which identity is yet to be disclosed. This is coming less than two months after the exciting debut of the Maxus brand with a memorable test-drive of the T60 pick-up in Lagos  Commenting on the coming of the veiled one, the General Manager,  Mikano Motors, Mr Ralph Haidar, stated, “this latest addition will complete and complement our product lineup, joining our Geely, ZNA and Maxus brands.” As usual, Haidar kept the name of the brand close to his chest, but it was gathered that plans were  fully underway to give the vehicle a grand launch in a manner that is very typical of Mikano Motors. Though auto enthusiasts have made several educated guesses on the mystery brand, Hardar said such guesses would be proven or disproven when an official announcement is made. In true Mikano style, the new automotive brand is being introduced in a grand and unique way on social  media. Specifically, a social media challenge where participants stand the chance to win a brand new 2023 luxury SUV is ongoing, and all that is required to win is a descriptive and creative expression of their dream car. There are also indications that the new brand  will be arriving with a wide array of models going by the subtle hints on promotional material released by Mikano Motors.  While the auto enthusiasts wait with bated breath,  everything points to Mikano Motors storming the market again as they did with the Geely brand in the past couple of years – with pomp and glamour!
