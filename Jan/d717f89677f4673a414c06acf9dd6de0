From Desmond Mgboh, Kano  Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, has vowed to tackle the menace of Almajiri ravaging the North if elected to power. He gave the assurance, yesterday, at a town hall meeting with Muslim leaders from the North West region. “If I become the president, I will work with you to establish a commission to find a lasting solution to the Almajiri problem,” he stated, adding that he would transform the enormous potential of Nigerian youths to something productive. He maintained that he cannot afford to neglect children because they are creations of God who had instructed parents to care for them from childhood to adulthood. Tinubu also pledged to tackle the insecurity bedevilling the country, adding, “we would not tolerate gangsters on our roads and highways. The sanctity of lives must be protected.” To achieve this, he declared he would increase the number of security personnel across Nigeria and provide them with better equipment to discharge their responsibilities. He also  pledged to be just and fair to all Nigerians while appealing to Muslim clerics to impress it on their followers to vote him on election day. In his remarks on the occasion, Governor of Jigawa State, Abubakar Badaru, said contrary to the speculations of their detractors, Tinubu is healthy. strong, mentally alert, competent and capable to discharge the responsibilities of the president.  He also said there is no way the interest of the North would be under-represented by the Tinubu administration, pointing out himself and Nuhu Ribadu are part and parcel of the Tinubu family and would not be part of any arrangements that would short-change the North.
