From  Molly kilete, Abuja The Police Service Commission has denied that it supported the tenure elongation of the  Inspector-General of Police, Mr. Usman Alkali Baba. The Commission was reacting to an online publication which stated  that PSC had supported the tenure elongation of Baba. In a statement by PSC Head, Press and Public Relations,. Mr. Ikechukwu Ani, explained that the attention of the PSC has been drawn to an online publication where the Commission was said to have endorsed the tenure elongation of Baba. “The online publication in a supposed interview with AIG Lawal Bawa( Retd), Honourable Commissioner in the Commission representing the Police, stated that the PSC Commissioner confirmed that the Commission “is not against the extension of the tenure of the Inspector General of Police.”. “It went further to quote the Honourable Commissioner “If the IGP feels that it will affect effective monitoring of the elections, let him write to the President for their extension, we (PSC) have no objection. “The Honourable Commissioner has since denied making such statement, stressing that he was obviously misquoted. “According to him, he told the online publication that it was the prerogative of Mr. President to decide. “The Commission, therefore, wishes to state that it has not endorsed any tenure elongation for the current Inspector General of Police. As a matter of fact the Commission was never contacted on this subject at any time. It notes that it will always commit itself to the letters and spirit of the laws of the land and will not at any time support or encourage any attempt to subvert these laws. “The Commission wishes to appeal to the media to avoid unnecessary sensationalism in an attempt to attract huge readership. “The Commission will also continue to work to ensure an effective and efficient Nigeria Police rooted in the rules and regulations governing it’s operations “.
