By Kenneth Udeh Senator representing Anambra North, Stella Oduah, has pledged to embark on more developmental projects for her constituents this year. Odua who is the senatorial candidate of Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in her new year message, solicited God’s blessings and protection upon her constituents. On her 2023 developmental agenda, she remained upbeat that the recently launched N200 million agro-entrepreneurship scheme that she facilitated for her constituents would have multiplier effect in boosting their economic livelihood. On her re-election, Odua said:”I am confident that you shall approach the forthcoming Anambra North senatorial election with the mindset of a people who understand the need to own and personalise our Oluchukwu campaign for no one can truly talk you into rejecting. Therefore, this 2023, I remain confident that you shall stand solidly behind my vision that seeks to continually push the envelope in terms of quality and qualitative service delivery.” While outlining her senatorial infrastructural and empowerment projects mapped out for the new year, Odua expressed optimism on the impact of other existing programmes which she instituted. Said Odua: “This year, I pray for Anambra North and its constituents that God shall unleash a wave of peace, joy and prosperity like never before seen in its annals and we shall spend every day of the year, rejoicing and praising Him for his many favours. I am particularly excited about the N200 million agro entrepreneurship scheme that shall be of immense benefit to farmers in our agrarian communities, the scholarship scheme designed to uplift at least 50 indigent students from each council, and the continuation of our low cost housing scheme which was of immense benefit to widows from each council.”
