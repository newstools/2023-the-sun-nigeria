By Kenneth Udeh Africa has been described as the cradle of the world’s civilisation and the emerging destination of global investment which can be achieved through the unity and diplomatic cooperation among its nations. The above were the assertions of the Senate Chief Whip, Dr. Orji Uzor Kalu, and the Republic of Djibouti on Saturday in Enugu, South Eastern Nigeria, during a visit by the representative of the latter to the Abia State home of Kalu during a four-day tour. Kalu, who played host to the Speaker of Djibouti National Assembly, Mohamed Ali Houmed, led his legislative counterpart from the Enugu International Airport where the Djibouti parliamentarian and his entourage had arrived to the Enugu home of prominent politician, Sir Chinyeaka Ohaa, where they were treated to a brief reception. In separate remarks, Kalu and Houmed maintained that Africa will soon become the rallying point for investment. They, however, stated that this could only be achieved through unity and the facilitation of deeper economic ties among African countries. In his remark, Kalu said civilisation began in Africa, saying the continent was on the verge of becoming the global rallying point for investment. Kalu admitted that, though like Nigeria, other countries were also experiencing economic difficulties, he however, stated that such problems were not peculiar to only Africa but globally. The former Abia State governor identified the COVID-19 pandemic and global depression as the major causes which were however not insurmountable by Africa. “Africa is one, this is where civilisation started and extended to other parts of the world. The new frontier for investment is Africa. I am confidently telling you that development is coming to Africa, but we must come together and unite as one despite our cultural and religious differences to achieve this.
