Telecommunications giants, Globacom, yesterday rewarded one of its loyal subscribers in Ibadan, Oyo State, with the house star prize of its ongoing Festival of Joy promo. Mariam Oyelami, a 25 year-old Nurse was drawn as the lucky winner of a three-bedroom apartment. At the presentation ceremony she said skepticism was her first reaction to the good news. “I have been a victim of fraud before. When I receive suspicious calls, I just shut down like I did. Now, I believe that I have indeed become a homeowner in Nigeria, courtesy of Globacom.”  The Sales Coordinator, West Territory, Globacom, Mr. Akeem Yusuf disclosed at the prize presentation ceremony which held at the house address in Oluyole Local Government area of the state that the “Glo Festival of Joy promo was initiated in celebration of our customers’ loyalty to the brand.
