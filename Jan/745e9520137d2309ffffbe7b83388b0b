Emeka Ihedioha, CON, who was duly elected by the good people of Imo State in the March 9, 2019 governorship election. “We make no pretences to state the fact that Rt. Hon. Emeka Ihedioha remains the darling and indeed the popular choice of the Imo electorate ahead of this year’s governorship election based on his sterling leadership qualities and unrivaled scorecard during the seven months of his Rebuild Imo administration. “We wish to seize this opportunity to caution overzealous elements not to play politics with our emotions. Finally, rumour mongers, peddlers of fake news, divisive elements and purveyors of deceitful ambition are hereby warned to steer clear of Mbaise land and desist from making further reckless and inflammatory statement with serious issues of governance of our state at this very critical time.”
