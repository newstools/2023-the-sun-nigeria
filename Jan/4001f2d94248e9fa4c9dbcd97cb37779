From Judex Okoro, Calabar Cross River Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate, Sandy Onor, has called on traditional rulers in the northern senatorial district of the state to invoke the gods and bees to sting anybody or group of persons who would attempt to rig election in February. Speaking at a consultative meeting with the traditional rulers in Ogoja, yesterday, Sandy said it was high time the royal fathers lived up to their responsibilities by telling the political leaders the truth about feelings of their subjects at all times and not to keep quiet even when things are going wrong. He maintained that the moment the traditional rulers take such disposition, politicians would stop lying endlessly, adding that the rate politicians make bogus promises is becoming alarming and derailing the democratic development.  “It is time the royal fathers used the traditional means to deal with the people who goes against the land. If you keep quiet and refuse to say anything, who would rescue us.  “All over the world, people are taking democracy very serious. So, you must take decision that would change the society by voting for serious minded-people. Chiefs should invoke the gods and possibly release bees to sting anybody who want to disrupt or rig election in Cross River. This would checkmate election rigging.” He promised to look into their welfare if voted into power. “I would run a  participatory government where all critical stakeholders would be involved in reconstructing the state.” Responding, paramount ruler of Ogoja, Oti Mathias Abua, represented by Buturu Slyvanus Abuo, the clan head of Ekumtak, said: “I have had opportunity to work with some politicians. We believe power comes from God. Victory is yours from what I have seen. We want a peaceful election without bitterness so that we can celebrate you all the winners.”
