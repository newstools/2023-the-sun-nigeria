Doing business in Nigeria is not for cowards and the lily-livered, as investors must be well prepared. To succeed, entrepreneurs must imbibe the will and capacity to always be aware and take measures to protect their business from corporate blackmail by some competitors who wish to see rivals go down or rubbish their credit rating or public image. Over the years, energy tycoon and Group Chief Executive of Oando Group, Jubril Adewale Tinubu, has battled, triumphed and led his premium oil and gas company into a behemoth that is being mentioned among the best in the international energy market. Since he founded Oando, Tinubu, a trained corporate lawyer, and his team have worked and are still working organically, on their vision to make Oando a top-of-the-mind brand. As an embodiment of numerous virtues, including diligence, excellence and integrity, the Lagos-born billionaire businessman has altered the equation in Nigeria, Africa’s biggest economy through innovation, experience and quality corporate culture. He grabbed life by the lapel and got transformed from a lowly beginning to an enviable status filled with accomplishments. Yet, his profile has continuously been on the rise. These and more have endeared Tinubu to many newshounds across the continent of Africa not because he loves publicity, but for his leadership qualities, brilliance and mastery. The Oando boss ticks all the boxes and tops the list in any award considerations by the media and other organisations. At the moment, his shelf overflows with awards and honours’ trophies. Again, Tinubu—a holder of the national honour of Commander of the Order of the Niger (CON)— has teed off the year with another coveted award bestowed on him by a Nigerian newspaper. He will be honoured among other world class business magnates, governors and top government functionaries.
