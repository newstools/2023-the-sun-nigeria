Not less than 250 golfers including professionals, amateur players, ladies, chief executive officers and members of the security organisations participated in this year’s Armed Forces Remembrace Day Golf tournament organized by the Defence Headquarters in collaboration with the Nigerian Golf Federation (NGF). The tournament was played on January 12-13 at the TYB Golf and Country Club, Mambilla Barracks, Abuja. The Chief of Defence Staff, General Lucky Irabor, who was represented by the Chief of Air Staff, Air Marshal Isiaka Oladayo Amao, performed the ceremonial tee off. The CAS noted that tournament was important to the Armed Forces as it afforded the military to remember its fallen heroes that paid the supreme prize as well as those who are still alive and contributed to making the country safer.  “The essence of the kitty is to also be able to generate small funds for those that are still living to assist them and also tell the nation that in as much as we are fighting war, we also keep fit in the course of fighting war,” Amao said. He lauded the involvement of NGF, which is the body in charge of golf in the country for staging the maiden Armed Forces, and Remembrance Day Golf kitty. On his part the NGF President, Otunba Olusegun Runsewe, thanked the Chief of Defence Staff for approving the partnership, which he said, will help foster harmonious civilian-military relationship. Runsewe, who is also the DG National Council for Arts and Culture (NCAC), noted that the golf federation had succeeded in using the kitty to bring new innovations in how tournaments are organised in the country.
