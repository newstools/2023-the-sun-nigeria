By Lukman Olabiyi Accord Party (AP) governorship candidate in Lagos State, Pastor Peter Obayuwana has decried the insecurity in the state, saying Lagosians deserves more than what Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu is offering. The governorship flag bearer in a statement held that the leadership of the state under Governor Sanwo-Olu had tried its best but its best is not good enough for Lagosians. He stated: “2023 is not a year for mere wishes. It is a year for decisive action. It is not a year for populist views, but one for introspection. It is a year for you to ask yourself tough questions devoid of sentiments. For this reason, I would like to advise Nigerians particularly Lagosians not to make this year 2023 about resolutions, but about the basic necessities of their lives. We all need water, electricity, food, shelter, good transportation system, security and a government that cares about the needs of the people.” He promised Lagosians that if elected at the forthcoming poll, he would provide them with a leadership that will address their needs, transform the economy of the state and restore the excellence that the state is known for.
