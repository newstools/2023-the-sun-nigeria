From Sola Ojo, Kaduna  The Kaduna State Government has said that the salary arrears of some of the newly recruited teachers would be paid this January. Permanent secretary, Ministry of Education, Dr. Halliru Musa Soba, said the delay was due to technical hitches associated with poor documentation at the point of the employment of the affected teachers, which is being rectified to ensure smooth payment of salaries, henceforth. “We will pay their allowances this January. We have an issue with ranking when they were employed. They were just given class teachers and how do we promote them in such a manner? No nomenclature.  “So that is what is responsible for the delay in their payments. We paid them one month’s salary in December to test the process. We have the money to pay them but we need to know their grades.  “It is not unusual to have this delay in the civil service as a new employee. I stayed six months before my salary came. I’m not saying this is cast in stone but just to add that it is not unusual. They can also request their pay slips.  “Some of them supplied wrong information when they are doing their documentation. For example, some of them inputted bank verification numbers that were not tally with their bank accounts. “I want to encourage our employees to come to us their employers when they need clarifications on any issue regarding their work. We are open to them”, he said.
