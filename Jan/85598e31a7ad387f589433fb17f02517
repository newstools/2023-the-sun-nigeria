The year 2022 has been described as an admixture of sweet and sour experiences for the whole world. In the Nigerian sports sector, and particularly in basketball, it was a year many critical and genuine stakeholders would quickly wish away. As the world earnestly look forward to a better new year, 2023, President of Nigeria Basketball Federation, Ahmadu Musa Kida, has sent a goodwill message to lovers of the big men’s game and Nigerians, home and in diaspora. In the message, Kida thanked God for His mercies and blessings on Nigeria. He was particularly thankful that despite the political and socio-economic challenges bedeviling the country, Nigerians can look forward to a better life in 2023. “As a people, we must be grateful to God for His mercies and blessings upon us as a people. Yes, like other countries across the world, Nigeria, also had its shares of challenges. However, we can still look forward to a better Nigeria in 2023,” the amiable sports administrator remarked. Kida expressed confidence in the fortunes of Nigerian sports, particularly basketball in 2023. He hinged his optimism on the new fervour and determination of the NBBF board and other critical stakeholders to take the game of basketball to higher heights.
