Former national chairman of Progressive People’s Alliance (PPA) and now member of national caucus of All Progressives Congress (APC), Sam Nkire, has advised Rivers State Governor, Nyesom Wike to make peace with his party, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).   Nkire quoted  a common parlance in politics which says the ‘party is supreme’, adding that, “Governor Wike has made his case so eloquently, it is now time to listen to the voice of the majority.” According to the APC chieftain, “no political party, not even my own party, the APC, is perfect or without members who feel they have been unjustly treated or marginalised. “In APC today, there are a great number of people at both the federal and state levels, including my state, Abia, who felt disappointed and dissatisfied by the outcome of the APC primaries recently conducted nation-wide; but most people have remained in the party, buried the hatchet and forged ahead,” Nkire said.  The Abia State-born politician emphasised that politics should not be about selfish interests all the time, but added: “ There comes a time when state and national interests become paramount in the mind of a party man and a true patriot.”
