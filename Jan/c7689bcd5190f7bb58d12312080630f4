The mark surpassed the World Championships qualifying standard of 6.85m, and has earned her an automatic ticket for the world athletics championships, taking place in Budapest later this year. This makes Usoro the second on the all-time African indoor list behind Chioma Ajunwa’s African Record (AR) of 6.97m and ahead of Ese Brume’s 6.85m (Silver medal-winning mark at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade last year). In 2020, she became the first Nigerian jumper in history to qualify for the Olympics in both the long and triple jump events. She repeated the same feat last year at the World Championships in Oregon. She got to the final of the long jump while in the triple jump she was a finalist at the World Indoor Championships in Belgrade, finishing eighth on the table.
