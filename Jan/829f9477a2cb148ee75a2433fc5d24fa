By Sunday Ani Media aide to Olumide Aderinokun, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Ogun Central senatorial district, Taiye Taiwo, has said the party will win the election slated for February 25, 2023. In a statement, yesterday, Taiwo said Aderinokun was ahead of All Progressives Congress (APC) candidate, Shuaib Salisu, in all areas of community development and empowerment programmes in the senatorial district.  He said there was no comparison between the two candidates, saying: “Comparing Aderinokun with a former government official who served as deputy chief of staff and a chief of staff with no physical contribution to his immediate environment is gross disrespect. “Jittery candidates will believe they can reinforce failure in the 2023 general election, however, the people of Odeda, Ifo, Ewekoro, Abeokuta South, Abeokuta North and Obafemi-Owode local government areas are ready to take over their future from clueless promises without actions.” He said Aderinokun was not bothered about the rumoured endorsements or unsolicited game that the APC has embarked on because his mass contributions to the grassroots, acceptability by the people and his hard work speak for him. “Although the spirit of giving is not inherited, you can’t give what you don’t have and Aderinokun has proved his gesture to humanity over the years without any government contract nor appointment. “Talkless of an individual who was in government for 12 years with resources readily available but waiting for an election in less than two months before making promises. The PDP outfit instills confidence ahead of the general election, fuelled by the good works we have done to ease the hardship caused by the current mismanagement and bad governance since 2019.”
