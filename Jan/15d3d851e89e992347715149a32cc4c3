From Lateef Dada, Osogbo Osun State Election Petition Tribunal has fixed Friday for judgment on the petition filed by former Governor Adegboyega Oyetola of the All Progressives Congress (APC) against the People’s Democratic Party (PDP), Governor Ademola Adeleke. The tribunal Secretary, David Umar, confirmed that the tribunal has fixed Friday for the judgment. He said the judgment will start by 9 am on Friday 27th January 2023. Oyetola and the APC had alleged that the result of the July 16, 2022 governorship election in the state had over-voting in 749 polling units. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), PDP and Governor Ademola Adeleke, claimed that over-voting occurred in only six polling units. The APC also challenged the eligibility of Adeleke claiming that he was purportedly awarded a degree barely 24 days after he acquired an equivalent of an O’level result. The tribunal began sitting on September 26, 2022. Please enable JavaScript This is a modal window. Beginning of dialog window. Escape will cancel and close the window. End of dialog window.
