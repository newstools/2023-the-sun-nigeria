By Chinwendu Obienyi Amid the nation’s huge infrastructure deficit among other weak economic indices, the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar says a private sector revival strategy can return Nigeria to the path of rapid growth and development. Atiku stated this at the Nigeria Economic Summit Group (NESG) Presidential Dialogue on the economy which held in Lagos on Monday. Whilst stating that the task to turn around the fortunes of the economy would not be an easy one, Atiku said that he has a good understanding of how to tackle the challenges facing the economy currently. “As head of the economic management team while I was Vice President, I was instrumental to designing a private sector revival strategy and advocated for the opening of the economy for private sector investments in several sectors and we made tremendous progress. I am sure you still remember the good old days of rapid economic growth with stable interest and exchange rates, low inflation, low unemployment rates, and low poverty headcount. We paid off nearly all of our foreign debt which was crippling the country. We will review government procurement processes to ensure value for money.Our government will tackle the deficit in infrastructure financing and fast-track infrastructure development in the country.” He said According to him, experience is important and it is important to avoid the mistakes of the recent past. This is election season. So, you will see and hear from snake-oil sales people, false prophets and purveyors of false hope and misleading statistics. There is, therefore, need for caution. He further said, “We must also remember that we cannot trust the doctor that poisoned and continues to poison the patient to be the one who provides the curative treatment. The stakes are too high, so we must get it right. This may well be our last chance to do so. “ The PDP flag bearer stated.
