Genius Hub Global Initiative, a Non-Governmental Organisation, in collaboration with International Organisation for Migration (IOM), has empowered 58 Edo youths with digital marketing and other in-demand skills. The training was done under the umbrella of Edo community-based Re-integration Project, an initiative of Genius Hub. Speaking at the graduation ceremony in Benin recently, Mrs. Isimeme Whyte, founder, Genius Hub Global Initiative, said the training was to improve socio-economic development in the state. Whyte, who expressed gratitude to IOM for the partnership, disclosed that the recipients of the initiative were selected from different groups including returned migrants, community members, and potential migrants. According to her, they were trained in filmmaking, cinematography, product design, scriptwriting, video editing, and digital marketing. Whyte explained further that 400 persons initially expressed interest but 58 were selected based on assessment for the programme that lasted for three months. She assured that the graduands would be given sophisticated starter packs to help themselves and their respective communities.
