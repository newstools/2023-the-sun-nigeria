From Geoffrey Anyanwu, Enugu Ahead of March governorship election, former Senate president and chieftain of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Chief Ken Nnamani, has advised governorship candidates, especially in the South East to forget the idea of becoming governor through the court. He said those hoping to become governors through court pronouncement would be living in fool’s paradise as the new electoral act has put a stop to such practice. Nnamani, who spoke in Enugu where he was the chief guest of honour at the second edition of the Frontier Discourse Public Lecture and Awards, stressed that any victory in the forthcoming election must be achieved through the ballot box. “The mistake some people are making is that they are living in the past. They think the court will pronounce them winners. Any victory this time around will be achieved through the ballot box. “I have a reason to say this, I chaired the last electoral and constitutional reform committee in Abuja, and some of the foundations we laid, such things are now showing up. “We suggested that three or four, or five judges should not take the place of Nigerian electorate. What does that mean? Court cannot pronounce you a winner anymore that is the new electoral act.” Apparently referring to what happened in Imo state with the last governorship election, Nnamani said, “Those who became number fifth or fourth, or sixth and all of a sudden they become governor is not going to happen. “So what the court can give to you now is, the highest relief you can get is to ask you to go back to the electorate, go back to the fields but they will not pronounce you a winner, and award you a gubernatorial seat. Some people are counting on that, they are living in the past. “So people that are counting on jumping from the roof and taking a seat, they are joking. It’s not possible this time around. So, as I said, let our people shine their eyes.”
