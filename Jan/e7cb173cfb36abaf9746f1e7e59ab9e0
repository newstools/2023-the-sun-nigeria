Assistant coach of Rivers Angels, Regina Akaraonye has expressed optimism ahead Wednesday’s Nigeria Women Football League (NWFL) Premiership clash with Heartland Queens in Owerri. Akaraonye admitted that the team has had it difficult so far but is optimistic that they will have a good game and result against their opponents. Wednesday’s match will be Rivers Angels’ second away game of the season – they lost their first game on the road to defending Champions, Bayelsa Queens. Akaraonye however believes the new crop of players still needs time to blend and get used to the team’s playing pattern. “We didn’t have a good start this season, it’s actually not how we normally kick off our campaign but we are already working on our lapses and will get it right in the game tomorrow. We are starting the year with a win over Heartland Queens. “We currently have new set of players who still need little time to blend and start getting it right. Few of them are still trying to get used to the weather here and our style of play as well,” Akaraonye said. Rivers Angels have always edged Heartland Queens both home and away and Akaraonye says Wednesday’s encounter won’t be any different from the previous encounters. “Heartland Queens picked up a draw against Bayelsa Queens in Yenagoa and I know they’d want to be a bit stubborn when we face ourselves tomorrow but we always know how to subdue them. Not that I am underrating them or anything, we will use our experience as an advantage to pick all three points. “Instructions have been given to the girls and they know exactly how to carry them out. Not even the bad pitch here will stop us from going home with a good result,” she added.
