People of Akpa Edem, Ozzi Edem and Okutu communities in Nsukka Local Government Area of Enugu State have told Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) candidate for Enugu North senatorial district in the 2023 general election not to bother coming to their areas to campaign. The people said Governor Ugwuanyi’s administration has been fair to them in terms of distribution of democratic dividends as well as political appointments in spite of the state’s lean resources and the nation’s economic challenges. They declared they will vote for Ugwuanyi and other PDP candidates in the state in the forthcoming elections in recognition of the governor’s magnanimity to their communities. Speaking when a delegation of Akpa Edem/Ozzi Edem ward paid Governor Ugwuanyi a visit at the Government House, Enugu, Silas Ifeanyi (Baba Edem), said the people of the two communities are delighted at the ongoing construction of their connecting road, the Ozzi Edem/Akpa Edem/Okpuje Road, which leads to Abuja through Idah in Kogi State. Ifeanyi said the communities  people are excited because “we have never seen this kind of development before,” adding that “many old people in my community, Akpa Edem, have never seen this kind of development before, especially those from Agu-Amagwu which is bounded by Uzo-Uwani, Okpuje and Kogi State.” Pointing out that the Akpa Edem and Ozzi Edem are agrarian communities, the leader of the delegation said when the road is completed, there will be sufficient food in Nsukka “because Agu-Amagwu people will convey their farm produce to Nsukka in large quantities with ease.” He beseeched God to continue to strengthen Governor Ugwunayi to complete the road and other ongoing projects of his administration in the state before the end of his tenure.
