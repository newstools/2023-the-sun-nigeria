From Lateef Dada, Osogbo The immediate past Governor of Osun State, Adegboyega Oyetola, on Monday returned to the state amidst a rousing welcome by members of his party, All Progressives Congress (APC). He stormed the Tinubu/Shettima campaign office where prayers were held for the success of the party at the tribunal and presidential election. Addressing members after the prayer, Oyetola said he returned to the state to reclaim his mandate and work towards ensuring the success of Asiwaju Bola Tinubu in the February election. He encouraged members to be steadfast and not be intimidated till the court will give judgment and returned him to power. “I am very happy to return home. I wanted to sneak into the state but I am surprised by this rousing welcome. I never tell anybody that I am returning to the state. I am surprised to be welcomed by this massive crowd. Thank you very much. “This year will be a great year for us all. The clerics have encouraged us that we should not doubt God over our prayers. The promise of God will come to pass. “God has told me that he will do two things for us this year. We are going to retrieve our mandate and Asiwaju Bola Tinubu will become the president of Nigeria. “I served Osun wholeheartedly for four years without resting and God intentionally orchestrated my rest for a while. “Let our mind be at rest, nobody can scare us off this state. I want to implore us that we should work hard for the forthcoming election. It is very important to us. Continue to hold your meeting and don’t be distracted. I am concerned that Osun has about 1 million voter cards uncollected. Please go and collect your PVC. Let us deliver 1 million votes for Tinubu/Shettima. “We are going to inaugurate PCC in the next few days, let the campaign continue. Let all the aggrieved members be at peace with each other, our motive must gear towards retrieving our mandate and the 2023 General Elections,” Oyetola added.
