Governorship candidate of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Abia, Ikechi Emenike, has predicted that 2023 would be a remarkable year in the history of the state. He said it would mark its liberation from over two decades of bad governance perpetuated by inept leaders and godfatherism. “This is the year to end godfatherism in Abia, the year to send looters out of government house, the year to break the chain of transferring power among people bereft of ideas of good governance.” He explained that with the arrival of new year, the 2023 electioneering has entered the homestretch, which would culminate with the election, hence the need for Abians to prepare and vote for change. He advised the electorate not to leave anything to chance as the general election has presented “a great opportunity for us to take back our dear state from the plunderers of our collective patrimony. “We must rescue our state so that we can develop and make it great as well as truly God’s Own State where transparency, accountability and people-ori- ented government would be entrenched.” A development economist, he reiterated his determination to lead the state’s rescue movement to a successful outcome at the poll after which he would set up the building blocks of development to activate a holistic development of the state. He urged the youths of Abia to cast off despondency associated with unemployment, assuring them that he would see to it that jobs are sustainably created with the establishment of the building blocks of development. Emenike also encouraged mothers to renew their hope of a new dawn in Abia where they would be empowered to take adequate care of their family.
