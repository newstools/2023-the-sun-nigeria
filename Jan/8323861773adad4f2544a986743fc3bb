Okonkwo said. “We understand that our customers rely on us to make those vital connections needed to make businesses profitable and bring families together in prosperity. So, through the CashToken Rewards programme, we want to give every 9mobile subscriber a chance of winning up to N100 million by recharging their lines or joining our fast and reliable network”. Every recharge of N1000 for existing customers or N200 for new customers earns the customer one CashToken. Cumulative credit recharge to the limit of N1000 for existing and N200 for new customers within a month also qualify for the reward scheme. Every CashToken generates an instant cash-back of N6 and is an entry into the National CashToken draws every Saturday at 9:00 pm on the AIT network. Subscribers can enter multiple times to increase their chances of winning. For every N1000 spent on data or airtime purchases, customers automatically get an entry into the weekly National CashToken Draw. Customers must dial *6700*09# to enroll on the CashToken platform before they can enjoy these benefits and can view and redeem their CashToken balances anytime by dialing *6700#. Accumulated CashTokens can be redeemed as 9mobile airtime/data or to pay for transactions with over 200 participating merchant platforms.
