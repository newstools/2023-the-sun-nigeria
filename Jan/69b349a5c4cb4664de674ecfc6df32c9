From Desmond Mgboh, Kano   The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has forwarded a petition to the various security agencies against a former Chairman of the party, Shehu Wada Sagagi, accusing him of impersonation and engaging in acts that could undermine the peace of the state.   The petition signed by the Secretary of the Caretaker Committee of the party in the state, Baba Lawal Aliyu and forwarded to the police and the Department of State Service accused Sagagi of parading himself as the authentic Chairman of the party in the state despite the fact he has since ceased to occupy the office.   The PDP said Sagugi was the Chairman of the dissolved State Executive of the party, and had dragged the National Working Committee of the party before Justice Taiwo Taiwo of the Federal High Court in Abuja to challenge the dissolution of his Executive.   They added that his dissolution was initially set aside by the high court, but was later upheld by the Court of Appeal Abuja, which ordered a return to status quo (The state of affairs before the filing of the suit before the Federal High Court.)   “The position of things as it stands today is that the judgment of the Federal High Court, Abuja which recognized the Shehu Wada Sagagi-led executive has been set aside by the Court of Appeal, Abuja, which means that he is no longer the substantive Chairman of the PDP in Kano State” they stated   The party, however, observed that ever since the judgment, Sagagi has refused to come to terms with it ,adding that he has continued to hold out himself as the Chairman of the PDP in Kano State.   They recalled that he appeared at the State Police Command organized event on peaceful democratic process and the signing of a peace accord for Kano State party Chairmen and gubernatorial candidates.   “He held out himself as the Chairman of the PDP in Kano State at that event despite knowing that the only judgment of court that recognized him as such has been set aside by the Court of Appeal, Abuja” they stated.   The party recalled that he also appeared on ARISE TV on the 23/12/2022 and held himself out as the state chairman of the PDP.   The party held that in the aftermath of the events, the members of party in the state had been gravely angered by his actions, while urging the security agencies to arrest the situation before it undermines the peace of the state.
