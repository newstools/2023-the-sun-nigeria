Legendary Blues and Super Eagles midfielder John Obi Mikel has apparently endorsed Chelsea’s recruitment of Joao Felix on a temporary basis from La Liga giants Atletico Madrid. Mikel, the most popular footballer of Nigerian descent to play for Chelsea, has given his approval of the signing of the Portugal dazzler by liking an Instagram post from Chelsea announcing the capture of the winger for the remainder of the season. Arsenal and Manchester United were battling to sign the Portugal World Cup star but Chelsea snatched him from under their noses, signing him on loan without an option to buy. Chelsea’s initial post confirming the signing of Felix has been liked by Mikel and 222,177 other Instagram users, 53 minutes after the published post. Chelsea’s brand new signing, Felix will wear the number 11 during his loan spell at Stamford Bridge. In a ten-and-a-half-year association with Chelsea before joining Tianjin Jinmen Tiger in 2017, Mikel made 372 appearances for the Premier League side.
