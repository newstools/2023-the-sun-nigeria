Ogun State Governor, Dapo Abiodun, has called on Nigerians to avoid actions capable of provoking one another and leading the country to another national conflict. Abiodun made the call during a special church service to mark the 2023 Armed Forces Remembrance Day at the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, Ake, Abeokuta, on Sunday. The governor specifically urged Nigerians who are fond of beating the drum of war to desist from such action as the general election was drawing closer, saying stop beating drums of war. “Let me call on all of us, we must do everything to ensure we avoid actions that are capable of provoking one another, actions that are capable of leading us to war or any other national conflict. “For people constantly beating the drum of war, let us ensure particularly, as we prepare for the 2023 general election, we do not do anything to over heat the polity,” he said. Abiodun, while noting that his administration in the last three and half years has lowered the political temperature in state and allowed every political party to go about marketing their franchise, appealed to Nigerians to participate in the forthcoming general election. The governor, who also called on youths in the country to shun all acts of violence and thuggery, urged parents and guardians to ensure their children and wards are not used as thugs during the election. He further noted that the 2023 election is a referendum on the performance of his administration, calling on the people of the state to come out in their large numbers and vote for the continuity of his focused administration. In his message with the theme, “Remembrance of our giants,” Bishop of United African Methodist Church, Ijemo, Abeokuta, Noah Adekanbi Olabisi, described January 15 as a date set aside to remember the great men and women who died defending the territorial integrity of the country.
