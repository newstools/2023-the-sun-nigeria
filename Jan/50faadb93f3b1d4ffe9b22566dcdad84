From Idu Jude, Abuja   Following the Appeal Court ruling over the matter before it to determine the authentic Labour Party governorship standard bearer in Enugu State, Mr Chijioke Edoga, one of the leading contestants listed by INEC on the platform of the Labour Party has come out to debunk the rumour that the appellate court ruling on Thursday had disqualified him from the race. Recall that Captain Everest Nnaji instituted a case in court, seeking for determination of by the court who should be the authentic governorship candidate of the Labour Party in Enugu State.   Chijioke Edoga, while addressing his followers through the party platform yesterday said: “This story is trending all over the place, and I have been receiving calls from all over the state. This is the true position, Captain Everest Nnaji, best known as Odengene, sued Labour Party in the Federal High Court before Justice Maha. The court ordered the Labour Party to repeat the primary elections for Enugu governorship. “Dissatisfied with the judgment, Labour Party appealed to the Court of Appeal. And I, Chijioke Edeoga, who was not a party to the case before the Federal High Court, got a lawyer, Maduabuchi Oba, to file an application to join the appeal as an interested party. While the lawyer was preparing his documents for the joinder application, the Court of Appeal heard the main appeal by Labour Party and adjourned for judgment. “The application for joinder now came up and the Court of Appeal, since it had already heard the main appeal, said it had been overtaken by events and struck it out. The main appeal filed by Labour Party is still awaiting judgment.”
