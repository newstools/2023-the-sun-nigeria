Soccernet.ng earlier reported that a journalist claimed that the Nigerian international would be sidelined for more than 6 weeks after picking a knock. The Super Eagles attacker, who scored the only goal in Nottingham’s victory against Southampton on January 4, was forced out of the match after picking up a groin injury. Although his team has not yet released a statement on how long the striker will be sidelined, the Athletic reports that the club is attempting to lure Newcastle’s forward to the City Ground stadium on a loan deal with a purchase option. According to reports, this is due to the Reds setting up a back-up striker since their primary striker would be sidelined for an extended period of time. Awoniyi would, however, miss some crucial games, which include their Carabao Semi-final tie against Manchester United and their tie against Manchester City in February.
