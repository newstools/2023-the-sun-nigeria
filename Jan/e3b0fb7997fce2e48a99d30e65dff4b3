From Tony John, Port Harcourt The Rivers State chapter of the Peoples  Democratic  Party (PDP) has said it has obeyed the necessary laws by paying the sum of N95 million to use  public facilities for its campaigns in the state.  The payment was in compliance with the precautionary requirement of N5 million for venue usage stipulated by Executive Order 21 issued last year by the  State government. A statement by the Chairman of the Publicity and Communications Committee of the Consolidation of the New Rivers Vision Campaign Council,  Ogbonna Nwuke, disclosed that PDP was merely leading by example and wished other political parties to follow suit.  Nwuke, in the statement, said  the party had received an official approval from the office of the Commissioner for Education, Prof. Chinedum Mbom, approving it to use facilities owned by the State.  The Executive Order 21 prescribes the payment of N5 million by political parties as precautionary fees for the use of facilities such as schools among others.
