From Fred Ezeh, Abuja Barring any change in plan, the sale of forms for the 2023 Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) will commence today. The UTME is an assessment examination conducted annually by the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) for candidates who desire to secure admission into tertiary institutions in Nigeria. The sale of forms, according to JAMB, would run till Tuesday, 14th February, 2023. Similarly, the Direct Entry (DE) registration, it added, would commence from Monday, 20th February and run till Thursday, 20th April, 2023 Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB), in a statement late last year, disclosed that Saturday, 29th April, 2023, had been fixed for the conduct of the 2023 UTME, and the examination was expected to run till Monday, 12th May, 2023. JAMB said it had also fixed Thursday, 16th March, 2023, for the conduct of its optional mock-UTME. It noted that interested candidates would be required to pay the sum of N1000 service charge for Computer Based Test (CBT) centres for the conduct of mock examination at the point of registration so as to prevent a situation where candidates would indicate interest to sit for the mock-UTME leading the various centres to commit human and material resources only to stay away on the day of the examination.  JAMB spokesman, Dr. Fabian Benjamin, in the statement, confirmed that the decision was taken at the end of JAMB’s management meeting.
