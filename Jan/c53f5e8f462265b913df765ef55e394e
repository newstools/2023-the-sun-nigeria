Following strident complaints by concerned Nigerians over the slow pace of the collection of Permanent Voter cards (PVCs) across the country, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) extended the exercise by one week. The exercise, which would have ended on January 22, was last week shifted to January 29, to enable all eligible voters to collect their voters’ cards. According to the National Commissioner and Chairman, Information and Voter Education Committee, Festus Okoye, INEC took the decision after its regular meeting, where the issue was discussed. “The commission is encouraged by the turnout of registered voters and the surge in the number of collected PVCs across the country,” Okoye stated. About 100,000 PVCs were reportedly collected since the exercise had devolved to the ward level on January 6, 2023. We decry the slow pace of collection of PVCS in many parts of the country as well as the attendant corruption and discrimination by INEC officials. It is also commendable that the electoral umpire is investigating allegations of corruption, discrimination leveled against its officials at some of the collection centres. The outcome of such investigations should be made public. INEC has also printed over 13 million PVCs for new valid registrants, transfer and replacement applicants. Not less than 93.4 million Nigerians are eligible to vote in the 2023 general election, which begins on February 25, 2023 with the Presidential and National Assembly elections. The Governorship and State Assembly elections will hold on March 11, 2023. In 2019 general election, INEC had 84,004,084 voters as against 93,469,008 for 2023. Out of this figure, 49,054,162 or 52.5 per cent are males while 44,414,846 or 47.5 per cent are females. A breakdown of the voting population shows that 37,060,399 or 39.65 per cent are youths between the ages of 18 and 34. Similarly, 33,413,591 or 35.75 per cent are middle aged persons between the ages of 35 and 49. In the same vein, 17,700,270 or 18.94 per cent are elderly voters between the ages of 50 and 69. And 5,294,748 or 5.66 per cent are senior citizens aged 70 and above. All eligible voters, including women and youths, should use the remaining period to collect their PVCs before the January 29 deadline. It is by collecting their PVCs that they can participate in choosing credible leaders. It is a matter of regret that millions of PVCs are yet to be collected in many states across the country. Therefore, we urge INEC officials, especially the Resident Electoral Commissioners and others involved in this exercise to ensure that all eligible voters collect their PVCs before the expiration of the new deadline without being extorted or discriminated against at any of the collection centres. Political parties, cultural and religious organizations are enjoined to sensitise their members on the importance of collection of their voters’ cards. Civil society organisations and leadership of town unions, market unions and other related associations should assist in the sensitisation campaigns. Instructively, Ohanaeze Ndigbo has urged the state governors in the South East to declare public holidays to enable workers in the region collect their PVCs. Other socio-cultural organization should emulate Ohanaeze Ndigbo in this regard. Let other states come up with similar measures to encourage their citizens to collect their PVCs. The conduct of a free and fair election begins with the collection of the voters’ cards. Without the card, no voter will be allowed to vote during elections. The importance of having the PVCS and voting can hardly be overemphasised. Voting is a civic responsibility of all eligible Nigerian citizens. Nothing should be allowed to vitiate it. While voting during elections is one of the ways most Nigerians can participate in the nation’s democratic process, it is also by voting that citizens can elect credible leaders, who will take the country to the next level of development and greatness. The nation’s nascent democracy can only thrive and endure with the election of visionary and honest leaders. With one month and some days to the 2023 general election, INEC must hasten the process of collection of PVCs so that no eligible voter will be disenfranchised.
