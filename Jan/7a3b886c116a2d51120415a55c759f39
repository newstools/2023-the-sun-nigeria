From Okey Sampson, Umuahia Abia State governorship candidate of All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA), Professor Gregory Ibe has denied making anti Peter Obi comment. An online report had it that Ibe had purportedly said he would not support the Labour Party presidential candidate because there was no arrangement for Obi to contest the 2023 presidential election. In a statement signed by Sleek Ogbonnaya Ogwo, Director, Media and Publicity, Prof Gregory Ibe Campaign Organization, the APGA Guber candidate said it was not true he made a statement that Peter Obi, ‘was not part of the plans for Igbo presidency’. The statement read in part, “We wish to state clearly that Prof Ibe never granted any interview to the said medium, nor did he make the statements credited to him in the said publication. “It is not surprising that those who feel threatened by the rising political profile and swelling support for Prof Ibe across the state are desperately looking for ways and means to demarket him. “Such detractors are the masterminds of this mischievous publication simply aimed at pitching Prof Ibe against his Igbo brothers and supporters of Peter Obi”. The statement urged members of the public to discountenance the publication as it is nothing but a big lie from the pit of hell. I’ve said his lawyers have been briefed to commence appropriate legal processes to repair the damages caused him by the publication.
