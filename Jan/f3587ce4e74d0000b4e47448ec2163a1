Nigerian music star, Asake alongside Ghanaian acts, Black Sherrif and Seyi Vibez, thrilled over 10,000 music and beer lovers at the maiden edition of Beer With Us Festival (BWUFEST), which held at Landmark Leisure Beach, Oniru, Lagos on Friday January 6, 2023. Championed by leading showbiz company, Achievas Entertainment Limited, the event was a mix of beer and music suffused with Afrobeats sounds. Asake, a rave of the moment since early 2022, did not disappoint his fans with the back-to-back performances of hit songs such as Palazzo, Sungba, Mr Money with the Vibe, Terminator, Peace be Unto You, and Joha amongst others. The 21-year-old Ghanaian star, Black Sherif, who gained recognition for his First Sermon and Second Sermon, went with the mystical story of “Kwaku the Traveler”. He got the crowd screaming for more. Maintaining the tempo, Seyi Vibez came in with his Yoruba and street lingo music that dazzled the audience. Speaking, Daniel Chiori Cole, an executive of Achievas Entertainment, noted that lots of people tagged the show a test run, but it turned out to be massive. “We have always been committed to our watchword, which is providing world class quality entertainment and that we did at the debut edition of BWUFEST. You never can tell what we have up our sleeves for the next edition,” he quipped. On her part, however, Aishat Anaekwe, a producer of the show, said the debut edition of the festival gave premium value to attendees, and therefore all hands are on deck toward proper planning of the second edition.
