Osun State Governor, Ademola Adeleke, has advised former governor Adegboyega Oyetola to accept defeat, saying his victory was from God. Adeleke’s advice is contained in a statement by his Chief Press Secretary, Olawale Rasheed, and made available to newsmen in Osogbo, yesterday. He was reacting to a recent com- ment credited to Oyetola on his possible return to power. The former governor had said at a prayer session organised in Osogbo by All Progressives Congress members to welcome him to the state that he heard from God that he would return to office as governor. But countering the comment, Adeleke said: “God is of justice, equity and honesty, not of electoral banditry and deceit.” According to Adeleke, the Holy Books even noted that the devil’s whispering is real and no one should mistake the voice of the devil for God. “Our Almighty God has spoken resoundingly in favour of Governor Adeleke and the former governor should accept defeat,” he said. Adekeke stated that there is life after losing an election. He further stated that the people of Osun State had moved on and “are now enjoying a new governance of openness, accountability, and responsiveness to yearnings and aspirations of the citizenry.” He contended that the state had launched a new chapter of new leadership and also returned the state power to the people, who are now feeling the new air of governance. “Never will Osun be returned to the years of locust,” he said.
