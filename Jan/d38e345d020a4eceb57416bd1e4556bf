From Tony Osauzo, Benin  A solidarity walk by Benin monarch, Oba Ewuare II, yesterday, caused a gridlock as residents and subjects queued up to catch a glimpse of monarch in Benin City.  The afternoon walk to the Palace started after the Thanksgiving Service at Holy Aruosa Cathedral (Edo National church of God) on Akpakpava street which climaxed the annual Igue festival. The traditional ruler had staged a similar road walk during his 6th year coronation anniversary thanksgiving in the church on October 23, 2022. Oba Ewuare II was accompanied by members of the Benin Royal family, Chiefs, Dukes (Enigie), Benin residents, worshippers in the church, Palace functionaries during the procession through the Oba Ovonramwen Square where fun seekers at the National Museum and traders in the locality trooped out to pay homage to him. Adjoining streets, linking the King square were temporarily locked down during the procession by the Oba who is the spiritual leader of the church amidst cultural dance, cheers and songs of oration eulogising the monarch. During the church Service, Oba Ewuare II, with members of the Royal family and Oloi (Queens) gave thanks to God and the ancestors. In a sermon titled, ‘Iwero’ (Greedy people), the presiding Priest of Holy Aruosa Cathedral, Ohen-Osa Edebiri Igbinoghodua, cautioned agitators for secessionist agitators including some Dukes (Enigie) involved in outrageous activities in Benin Kingdom. to retrace their steps in order not to incur the wrath of God and ancestors. Igbinoghodua also advised groups conspiring with Dukes in Benin Kingdom to administer certain areas in the Benin Kingdom on behalf of the Oba not to divide Benin Kingdom.
