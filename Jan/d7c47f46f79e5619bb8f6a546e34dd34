By Gilbert Ekezie     The General Overseer of The Lord›s Chosen Charismatic Revival Ministries, Pastor Lazarus Muoka, has revealed that 2023 shall be greater in glory than other years past.  He made the revelation at the ongoing four-day international crusade tagged: Mgbidi-Lagos Experience, with the theme “What God has Determined Shall Be Done,” holding at the church’s headquarters in Lagos. Muoka told the worshippers that God will make them succeed, educationally, materially, financially and health-wise, pointing out that 2023 will be far greater in glory than any other year Nigerians have come across. “I have spoken; the rest is left to the angels to carry out. The Lord confirms the words of his messengers; when I say something, it must come to pass; anything I say here, there is power in it; that word that made 18 years blindness to go; that word that made 13 years spirit of madness to disappear; that same word is capable to heal and deliver you from your troubles. By this time next year, you shall line up here for testimonies.” He said that what God had determined for each person that was present at the programme would be done in their lives. “What God has determined for you these four days shall be done; and what God says, nobody can oppose it.” Muoka added that God was at the crusade to honour their declarations because “what is bound on earth is bound in heaven, and what is loosen on earth is loosen in heaven. God said that heaven and earth shall pass away, but not an iota of his word will go unfulfilled, so, God’s word is irrevocable.”
