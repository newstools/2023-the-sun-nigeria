From Romanus Ugwu, Abuja The All Progressives Congress (APC) Tinubu-Shettima Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), has commended the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and its Governor, Godwin Emefiele, for listening to the voice of well-meaning Nigerians on the exigency of extending the deadline for change of old N200, N500 and N1000 naira notes to new ones. In a statement signed by Bayo Onanuga, Director, Media & Publicity, the APC PCC noted that; “we welcome the 10 days extension of deadline and the additional seven days of grace.” “Following difficulties experienced by Nigerians across the country from getting the new notes via ATMs and over the counter from Banks, many Nigerians especially requested for an extension of  the January 31, 2023 deadline. “This window will  enable Nigerians especially those in rural and remote areas to have more time to change their old notes and avert the panic that would have followed. “We specially commend Presidential Muhammadu Buhari for approving this extension and for his leadership and statesmanship,” the statement read. The APC PCC also used the opportunity to commend the presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu, noting: “In the same vein, we praise Tinubu for his forthrightness in addressing the concerns of Nigerians at his campaign rally in Abeokuta last week.  “Asiwaju Tinubu didn’t take the easy road by shying away from what would have caused serious inconvenience for our teeming masses. Asiwaju showed leadership and compassion for the welfare of Nigerians, at the most appropriate time,” the statement read.
