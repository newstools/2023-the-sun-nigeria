Sports betting firm, BetKing, has launched a campaign themed: ‘Kings know when to stop’, to encourage responsible gaming ecosystem. The campaign features a three-part TVC that encourages players to maintain responsible gaming behaviours by recognising and sticking to their limits. The videos leveraged relatable scenarios to communicate the importance of setting and adhering to limits when partaking in any activity, including sports betting. The three films feature BetKing Brand Ambassador and Nigerian football legend, Jay Jay Okocha, reality TV star, Seyi Awolowo, and social media content creator, Ope Keshinro (SwitOpe) engaging in different activities, including exercise, eating and shopping. Each of the films showcases the challenges of not adhering to limits and how sticking to limits delivers better results.  The three creatives present strong proof points to attest to how BetKing is promoting responsible gaming in the local sports betting ecosystem. Speaking on the campaign, Managing Director for KingMakers Nigeria, Gossy Ukanwoke, said: “Responsible gaming is about using betting for fun and entertainment, and at BetKing, we recognise customer education is critical to upholding best practices. This campaign teaches the importance of self-control and emphasises on the importance of personal discipline when engaging in various activities, including sports betting. “The launch of the ‘Kings Know When to Stop’ campaign is in line with our commitment to be the brand at the forefront of responsible gaming in Nigeria. It is critical to use our platform to inform and motivate punters to play responsibly. We are also setting an example for other stakeholders in the digital entertainment sector who must also recognise their responsibility to address the drawbacks of sports gaming as much as we all embrace the upside.”
