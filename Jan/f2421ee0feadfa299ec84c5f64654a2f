Winners have emerged at the second edition of the Nigeria Most Respected CEO awards, held recently in Lagos. The award was put together by NG Buzz Executive, Abuja, in collaboration with the Federation of West Africa Chamber of Commerce and Industry (FEWACO), International Business Council Africa and Africa Chamber for Trade. Award organiser, Baroness Paulette Kporo, said: “The award is conceived because we realised a vacuum in the reward system in the corporate community in Nigeria. We conceptualised the awards to identify and publicly recognise the CEOs in various sectors of the economy. “They are highly regarded and appreciated by various stakeholders. They have contributed the most to the best corporate reputations in Nigeria. “The awards identify the most respected CEOs in each sector of activity on the basis of what they have contributed to the success of the organisations they lead.” Kamlesh Jain, Chief Executive Officer, Excelminds Corporate Services, added: “This award celebrates achievements of leaders on how emotionally and intelligently they work to the growth of their companies. “It celebrates CEOs who have shown unmatched dedication and initiatives for their businesses and growth in the past years. These CEOs inspire, celebrate, motivate and appreciate their team. They should be commended and spotlighted for their extraordinary efforts.”
