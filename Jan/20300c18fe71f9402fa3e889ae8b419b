The Nigeria LNG Ltd. says its plant on Bonny Island is still active despite a force majeure declared in October 2022 and feed gas supply challenges. Mr Andy Odeh, the General Manager, External Relations and Sustainable Development, NLNG, confirmed this in a statement on Monday in Lagos. Odeh said the plant continued to produce LNG and Liquefied Petroleum Gas commensurate with the feed gas it received from its upstream gas suppliers. “In addition to ensuring steady operation, NLNG remains committed to its culture of transparency and maintains consistent communication with key stakeholders on developments in the upstream sector. “The company is closely monitoring the resolution of supply challenges by all relevant parties,” he added.  Meanwhile average retail price paid by consumers to purchase Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) also known as cooking gas has continued to skyrocket. This was as reports have shown that LPG retail market average retail cost of refilling 12.5kg gas cylinder rose to N9, 700 in December 2022 as against N7,800 earlier. The price of refilling 3kg gas cylinder stood at N2,600 as against N1,800, and 5kg cylinder at N4, 600 as against N3,500.
