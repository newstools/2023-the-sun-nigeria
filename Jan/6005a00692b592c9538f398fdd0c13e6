From Magnus Eze, Enugu   All Progressives Congress (APC) House of Representatives candidate for Ohaozara/Onicha/Ivo (Ohanivo) federal constituency of Ebonyi State in the February 25 polls, Felix Igboke, has vowed that he would not disappoint his people if voted into office.  Igboke, who promised the people effective representation, blamed truancy and inability to relate with constituents as the bane of some previous occupants of the seat.  Addressing a huge crowd at the flag-off of his campaign at Isu, headquarters of Onicha Local Government Area, the former council chairman said several people see elective positions as business ventures where they must recoup their investments and make profits.  He said: “As I go to Abuja, I will not disappoint you; my dear constituents, I won’t say that I will tar roads and build bridges but I assure you of effective representation. We will pay priority to getting our people federal opportunities. We will look out for agricultural grants for our farmers; that’s the kind of empowerment that will affect large number of our people.”   Like Igboke, other speakers at the event, including former deputy governor of Ebonyi State, Chigozie Ogbu, Chairman of Onicha council, Chidebere Uzor and former chairman, Ivo council, Aroh Nweke, urged members to work for APC victory at all levels.  Ogbu said the APC in the state recognised equity, justice and fairness in choice of its candidates for the various elective positions across the state.  “Onicha has always produced the highest votes, but I urge all of our people not to be violent during the forthcoming elections. Onicha people are not known as violent people, so, let’s go out and vote peacefully and return to our homes.  “Remember that any violence would lead to cancellation of votes in that affected polling unit and the electoral law is clearly against violence,” he said.
