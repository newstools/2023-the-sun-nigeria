Special assistants that served under former governor Ibikunle Amosun administration have called on Governor Dapo Abiodun to offset their severance gratuity which has not been paid since the erstwhile governor left office. The political office holders who served the Ogun State government between 2015 and 2019 made the plea in a letter signed by four former aides. The aides that signed the letter addressed to Abiodun are: Soyombo Opeyemi, Olusola Balogun, Gbenga Adekanmbi and Lanre Adeagbo. The former aides who claimed to have met with Governor Abiodun on September 1, 2022 said he promised to offset their severance gratuity. In a earlier letter obtained by Daily Sun, the public servants paid a glowing tribute to the current administration. “We wish to place on record our appreciation of your giant strides since May 29, 2019. In particular, we note the construction of the all-important Abeokuta-Sagamu Interchange road, among other massive construction projects going on across the state. No one can ignore the fact that you not only retained the 2,000 workers employed by the previous administration but went ahead to pay them nine-month salaries, which pleasantly surpassed expectations of the citizens of Ogun State. This rare gesture confirms your human kindness. “We earnestly appeal to Your Excellency to pay our severance allowance. Many of us resigned our jobs in order to serve our state. As the current helmsman, you would have taken cognisance of our plight during the four years of our faithful and selfless service. As we noted in our earlier letter on the subject matter, dated June 6, 2019, we humbly plead with Your Excellency to kindly offset the severance in order to encourage sacrificial service to the people of Ogun State by public office holders.”
