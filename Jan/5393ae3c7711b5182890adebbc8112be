From Jeff Amechi Agbodo, Onitsha The Anambra Youth Vanguard has decried the high degree of crime in major cities such as kidnapping and gruesome killings of innocent citizens in the state. The group said more than 91 kidnappings took place in the state between October and December. The chairman of the group, Mr. Nnamdi Onaya, a lawyer, in a statement, called for an overhaul of various departments of the State Police Command that have to do with crime, especially the Anti-kidnapping Squad. Onaya lamented that the state had been under siege by criminal elements, saying the security operatives were helpless in confronting these criminals. The youth group stated that, from the investigation they conducted in the state, the entire Anambra South and Anambra Central might have been taken over by criminal elements. It also condemned the brutal murder of Obosi President-General and nine others this January, 2023. Giving a breakdown of the activities of criminal elements in the state, they said, in Umeoji, Idemili North alone, there were about four kidnapping gangs; Ideani, three kidnapping gangs; Oba-Mili John in Ojoto, two; Nkpor, Old Road, three; Nnobi-Oraukwu, two; Ezinfinite-Uga, three; Oraukwu-Ekwulobia, one; Oraukwu-Uga, two; Obosi, four groups.
