Crystal Palace young goalkeeper, Owen Goodman will no longer join the Flying Eagles training camp in Abuja ahead of next month’s U20 AFCON. A source close to the family of the young shot stopper simply told SCORENigeria: “The boy will no longer fly down to the Flying Eagles camp.” Another source said Goodman opted out of the Flying Eagles after he was asked to foot his travel costs to Nigeria. Flying Eagles officials told SCORENigeria that such an arrangement was not strange as players will be reimburse their travels costs should they make the final cut to the tournament in Egypt. He was one of five goalkeepers from the Premier League in England invited by the Flying Eagles. Goodman, who has a professional contract with Palace, has been called up to the England U18s and U23s.
