English Premier League club, Fulham wants to sign Super Eagles striker, Josh Maja from Bordeaux this January. Maja has been one of the best Nigerian strikers in Europe this season. The former Sunderland has been a shining light for Bordeaux this season with eleven goals and three assists in 19 Ligue 2 appearances. His performances have not gone unnoticed, as Girondins reports that Fulham is interested in adding him to their roster. According to Girondins, Fulham has initiated talks with Bordeaux. Fulham has been great in the Premier League this season. Despite just gaining promotion, coach Marco Silvaâ€™s lads have punched above their weight. They currently sit sixth in the Premier League. Aleksander Mitrovic has been a reliable poacher for the Cottagers with eleven goals after 16 games. Still, Maja could add some bite to their attack with his pace and trickery on the ball. He could also provide an option from the wings.
