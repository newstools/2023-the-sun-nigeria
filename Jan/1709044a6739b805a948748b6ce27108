The Okpekpe international 10km road race tops the list of 16 road races in Nigeria certified by World Athletics after the world body updated the list of certified road races in the world last December. Okpekpe international 10km road race is the first road race in Nigeria to have its course measured by a World Athletics and AIMS certified course measurer and the first in West Africa to be granted a label status. This means the Okpekpe race is the first truly world class road running event in Nigeria after it was granted a bronze label status in 2015, upgraded to silver and now gold for the ninth edition scheduled to hold May 27, 2023 in Okpekpe near Auchi, Edo State. Also certified is the Access Bank Lagos Marathon, the second World Athletics label road race in Nigeria and its 10km component which is deemed a separate race. Four road races have been certified in Abuja, two in Ijebu Ode, three in Kaduna, two in Onitsha, one in Abeokuta and the Osogbo Brandove Osun Women’s Run 10km race. By the certification, all performances achieved at these races will be eligible for top lists of performances, entry standards for major championships and Games, world rankings and world records. The 16 races have had their courses measured by World Athletics certified measurers and all hold valid International Course Measurement Certificate which lasts for five years from the date of the initial measurement. Okpkekpe international 10km road race’s certificate and that of the Access Bank Lagos Marathon will also expire in 2026. All the four races in Abuja will have their certificate expire in 2025 while the two in Onitsha and the Abeokuta 10km race will expire this year.
