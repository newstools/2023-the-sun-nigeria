By Luqman Olabiyi An estate agent, Mutairu Owoeye, has described the presidential flagbearer of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu, as the most suitable candidate that every Nigerian should support and vote for. Owoeye, in a statement in Lagos, said the executive and legislative experience coupled with his performance as Lagos State governor gave him an edge over other contestants. He described Tinubu as a leader capable of moving the people towards the prosperity that is imminent for Nigeria. He said: “Nigeria will be in a safe hand if they vote for Tinubu. He has lifted many people to high political posts, during and after his tenure as governor. “I am convinced by the achievement of Tinubu as governor and I hope he will perform better as president of the country. “We should, as responsible citizens, vote for the good and the best, Tinubu, and vote en masse for him to lift Nigeria. “Tinubu has a good record. He is not just vying for the position. He has something to offer. With him as president, we can be sure the country is in safe hands. He is the best candidate for now. “Tinubu is a leader of leaders not by accident but by his unrelenting investment in human resources. He is a master planner, a pathfinder, a strategist, goal-getter, with the foresight to identify potential and bring out the best in them.” He expressed confidence that Nigerians would vote for  APC based on Tinubu’s achievements.
