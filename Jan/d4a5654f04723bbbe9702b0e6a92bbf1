The winners cash prize for the Bullet Energy Basketball Tournament has been raised by a hundred percent. The winning team will now take home the sum of N2million as the prize money as against N1million for the last edition that was held in November in Lagos. The improved package means the runners up will go home with N1million and the third placed team will earn N500k. It was leant that the competition started on a lower prize monies as the earlier events were held as test runs for bigger events in the coming months and years. The Bullet Energy drink basketball tournament which is powered by the Sam Oguche Foundation began as beginners camps in Onitsha, Anambra State nearly one decade ago. Apart from the increased winning prize, the organisers of the competition have announced that the next edition which has been confirmed for Asaba will be an all female competition. Sam Oguche who explained the new development said it was in the best interest of basketball development in Nigeria. “Initially, we didn’t plan for a competition exclusive to the women; we are just being dynamic. We are looking at the situation on ground around basketball in Nigeria, and responding positively to it. “If you check closely you would agree that the men have a lot of competitions going on especially around Lagos. Often times, the women’s teams are just squeezed in to participate. Even on the continent it is more of the men’s club playing. And so we have decided to give the ladies a full platform; like a fill up to their league. “It is a part of the reasons the prize money was increased. We want something that is very attractive to the ladies; a competition they will give all and make the fans and sponsors feel good. For now, it stays with the ladies.” Kwara Falcons won the men’s trophy in December while the First Bank women won their category.
