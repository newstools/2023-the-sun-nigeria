It is important for any entrepreneur who strives to be at the top-echelon of their industry to encapsulate sheer resilience. But in life, it’s more important to be a great human being, and that’s who energy tycoon, Chief Orikolade Karim truly is. For the billionaire owner of Shoreline Group fondly called Kola Karim, being good to people always is akin to how one of the holy books describes a good man: someone who is ever benevolent to others without batting an eyelid and ultimately becomes a best man without fear or favour. He has always believed in an unquenchable attitude of being good to people, especially to those who are not as richly endowed as him. Not many would forget in a hurry, the year 2013 when Karim, a very long time patron of Ralph Lauren, hosted an exclusive summer event alongside Argentine businessman and fellow Polo buff, Nacho Figueras at Ralph Lauren Store on Bond Street to celebrate Nigerian Polo. After the event, the legendary Ralph Lauren donated 15 per cent of sales to a charity of Karim’s choosing —one benefiting autistic children. A decade after, Karim, the Agbaoye of Ibadanland hasn’t changed a bit. He has simply become more of a genuine patriot who generously donates time and money to several Nigerian causes. And these numerous acts earned him to be listed in the book ‘The Making and Makers of Nigeria at 60’ as one of the Top 100 Builders of Nigeria. However, what many find even more fascinating about him is his modesty and goodness to fellow humans. When he clocked 54 in November last year, he celebrated the new age with ordinary people. The same he did at the just concluded Christmas and New Year festive season as he lifted many souls who experienced his giving spirit.
