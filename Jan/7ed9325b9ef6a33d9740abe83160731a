From Ndubuisi Orji, Abuja Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP) has said President Muhammadu Buhari has succeeded in fulfilling his promise to take  the country “ from top to bottom”. National Publicity Secretary of the party, Debo Ologunagba, stated this, yesterday, while reacting to the claim by President Buhari that he has fulfilled his campaign promises to the country . Ologunagba claimed the President had promoted “poverty as an act of governance”, saying Nigerians were worse off under the All Progressives Congress ( APC) led Federal Government. He said: “Probably he is correct  to the extent that he said he will bring Nigeria from top to bottom; he succeeded in bringing Nigeria from top to bottom. He succeeded in bringing disunity, he succeeded in bringing and promoting tribalism and religious jingoism in Nigeria.  “He succeeded in making sure that there is mutual suspicion among all the cohesive units of Nigeria before he came in. If that is his own brand of achievement, yes indeed he has succeeded. But Nigerians will record him as one of the worst presidents ever.”  The opposition spokesman added that “Nigerians are happy that elections are coming. And we can’t wait for him to go. We tell him thanks but no thanks. “ But he knows in his heart of heart that even if he is being told that he has done well, he knows that he has not done well. He has brought in misery to Nigeria. Where he met a bag of rice at N7, 500, he left it N50, 000. He met the price of petrol at N87 ( per litre), he is leaving it at between N400 and N500 per litre. He left Nigerians more divided. Where if you need to travel by road, by air and rail you need to do a special prayer. Nigerians will remember him for  that. History will judge  him as appropriate.”
