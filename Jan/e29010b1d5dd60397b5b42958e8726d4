From Timothy Olanrewaju, Maiduguri  Uncertainty surrounds students’ payment of reviewed registration fees at the University of Maiduguri (UNIMAID), Maiduguri, Borno State, nearly two weeks after the resumption of academic activities.   The Education Report observed that many students were yet to pay the new registration fees following a directive by the National Association of Nigerian Students (NANS) kicking against the new charges.   The association, during a press briefing last week, asked the management of the university to rescind its decision on the upward review of students’ registration fees by about 200 per cent from the initial amount.   NANS national vice president (special duties), Suleiman Sarki, told The Education Report the association’s earlier stand still subsists, urging UNIMAID to show concern.  “We still maintain the new registration fee is too high. We urged all UNIMAID students not to pay until NANS concludes the discussion with the university authorities,” he declared.   He said the NANS leadership was scheduled to meet with UNIMAID management before the end of this week.  However, some students said they had started paying the new registration fees while some said they were waiting to see the outcome of the NANS engagement with the university’s management.   “I haven’t paid. This is why I couldn’t start my registration. I don’t even know whether or not I should pay,” said Musa Saleh, a 200-level student.   But his colleagues, Adetoto and Mustapha (other names withheld) said they planned to pay theirs this week, especially with the new window that allows students to pay in two installments.   UNIMAID director of radio and publicity, Prof. Danjuma Gambo, could not be reached for reaction comment at press time.   Last month, UNIMAID announced an upward review of students’ registration fees, with students now to pay between N100, 000 to N150, 000 from the initial N25, 000 and N50, 000 depending on the course of study.
