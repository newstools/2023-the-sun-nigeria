In a report titled “The Best Performing Stocks in Nigeria in 2022,” compiled and analysed by Nairametrics, Wema Bank’s share price appreciated by a whopping 441.7 percent. This helped it to close the 2022 year at N3.9, down from the 72 kobo recorded at the end of 2022. The bank recorded a healthy 51 per cent increase in gross earnings in the first nine months of 2022 and a 31 per cent increase in post-tax profit. Investors rallied around the bank’s stocks despite a general downturn in most banking stocks during the year.

After many years of dividend freeze, the bank resumed dividend payment to shareholders three years ago.
