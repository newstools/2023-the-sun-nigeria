Ooni of Ife, Oba Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi, Olowo of Owo, Oba (Dr) Ajibade Gbadegesin, and Olu of Warri, Ogiame Atuwatse III were some of the bigwigs that graced the wedding of Afrobeats singer, Prince Olumuyiwa Ajibola aka Danny Young recently. The wedding ceremony, which was strictly by invitation, turned out to be a carnival of sort when Young’s colleagues took over the reception with performances they tagged: ‘grab the mic’. Entertainers that added colour to the wedding ceremony included Kenny Blaq, Style Plus, Peruzzi, Korede Bello, Seyi Law, Sean Tizzle and CDQ. Please enable JavaScript This is a modal window.
