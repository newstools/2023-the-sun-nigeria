By Merit Ibe The National Association of Chambers of Commerce, Industry Mines and Agriculture ( NACCIMA), has lamented the unfavourable economic environment, calling on the Federal Government  to partner the private sector in enunciating policies that will enhance feasible solutions to the myriad of challenges facing the country.  In his new year message, President of NACCIMA, John Udeagbala, noted that a reflection on the year 2022 showed that it was one with significant economic complications – a post-COVID year with the lingering Russia-Ukraine war that added to the spiralling global inflation. He noted that 2023 opens a window for government to appropriately review and jettison policies that have suffocated viable business establishments and have had drawbacks on well-established private companies that are presently struggling.  He promised that NACCIMA,  being a leading member of the OPSN is willing to partner the government on ways to ensure economic growth and transformation. “NACCIMA will continue to advocate for policies that will enhance ease of doing business and bring about further investments into the economy both locally and through FDIs. “In Nigeria, the year witnessed unprecedented high cost of energy, general rise in cost of doing business, goods and services, government debts with a tepid growth in GDP and high interest rates, (resulting from MPC rate adjustments), from which the private sector experienced a harsh economic environment which has made lots of businesses struggle to survive,” he said. “We thus have  on our hands, a case of persistent inflation, high unemployment rate while wage levels have remained stagnant or declining in real terms, due to the weakening Naira.Despite all the above we must continue to weather through the Nigerian economic stormy clouds through advocacy for policies that will enhance ease of doing business. The NACCIMA boss said the year 2023 is electioneering year to choose  political leaders that will steer the ship of Nigeria for another four years; he  therefore, urged citizens to make sure they perform their civic responsibility peacefully “by going out on election days to vote according to your conscience and ensure that your vote counts.
