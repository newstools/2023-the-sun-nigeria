From Priscilla Ediare, Ado-Ekiti The National Rescue Movement(NRM) candidate in the June 18, 2022 governorship election in Ekiti State, Ifedayo Iyaniwura, has congratulated the Governor of the state, Biodun Oyebanji, on his 100 days in office. Iyaniwura, in a statement he personally signed and made available to Daily Sun, on Friday, in Ado-Ekiti, said Oyebanji has shown exemplary leadership and tireless devotion since assumption of office on October 16, 2022. “Before June 18, 2022 Ekiti Guber Election, the question was, who succeeds Dr. Kayode Fayemi? ” Fortuitously, it was Biodun Oyebanji. No regret whatsoever, for Ekiti People have been searching for that Governor who combines the dash of elitism with the connection of the grassroots, a Governor who possesses the wisdom of native intelligence with the sophistication of befitting towering influence of bureaucratic excellence, a Governor who will fraternize with the masses and revere the elders whilst staying accessible to the locals. “A passionate Governor who believes in the laudable vision of her forebears and will not desecrate the institutions of good behaviour, self-respect and courtesy Ekiti is known for. A fusion of a home breed Governor and an exposed Technocrat with proven track record of passion for Ekiti people, all these aforesaid we have found in Biodun Oyebanji, that Ekiti leaders refer to as Omoluabi of Ekiti (The Freeborn, and the blue blood of Ekiti).” The former Chairman of Conglomeration of all the Registered Political Parties in the state prayed to God to grant Oyebanji the wisdom, knowledge and understanding to take Ekiti to a promise land.
