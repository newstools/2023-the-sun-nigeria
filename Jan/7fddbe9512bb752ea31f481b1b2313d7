From Paul Osuyi, Asaba Deputy Senate President, Ovie Omo-Agege on Friday came under attacks by the Delta State Government for warning banks in the state against further advancement of loans to the Governor Ifeanyi Okowa-led administration billed to wind up on May 29, this year. Commissioner for Information in the state, Mr. Charles Aniagwu who spoke at a news conference in Asaba said Omo-Agege has no right or powers to stop the government from carrying out any constitutional action.  He said the state government operates an open government and had been transparent and accountable to the people in all its financial dealings. He said Omo-Agege who is the governorship candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has consistently failed to tell the people what he intends to do but rather resorted to personality attacks on the governor who was not on the ballot with him. He explained that “any time that there is a need for us to talk about a facility, we follow the process. First, there would be an EXCO approval, upon which we will go to the House of Assembly. After we get an approval from the House of Assembly, we also ensure that we observe all the conditions precedent.  There has never been anytime we took any facility without making it public, because part of the processes include briefing the media at different levels of the process.” The commissioner also implored Omo-Agege to channel his energy to drawing the Federal Government attention to the deplorable condition of federal roads across Delta State.
