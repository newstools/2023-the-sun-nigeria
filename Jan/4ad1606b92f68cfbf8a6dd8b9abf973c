From Obinna Odogwu, Awka The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo Worldwide has asked South East governors to double whatever efforts they are making to secure the release leader of Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), Nnamdi Kanu. It specifically tasked Governors  David Umahi, Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi, Okezie Ikpeazu and Hope Uzodimma  of Ebonyi, Enugu, Abia and Imo States respectively to join their Anambra counterpart, Prof. Chukwuma Soludo, in calling for Kanu’s immediate and unconditional release. Vice President of the apex Igbo group, Chief Damian Okeke-Ogene, said there was the need for the governors, and indeed other stakeholders from the zone to intensify calls for the IPOB leader’s release. Soludo had, during the 2023 campaign flag off of the All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) held at Dr Alex Ekwueme Square, Awka, Anambra State capital, last Saturday, demanded Kanu’s release from detention. The Anambra governor went further to present himself as Kanu’s surety in the event that the Federal Government would not be able to release him unconditionally. Soludo said that he needed the IPOB leader “in the roundtable conversation to discuss the security in the South East.” IPOB, while commending Soludo for calling for Kanu’s immediate and unconditional release from detention, however, rejected his offer to stand surety for him, saying that Kanu has been acquitted by the court. It, however, preferred that the Federal Government should obey court order discharging and acquitting its leader, Kanu. Chief Okeke-Ogene, while commending Soludo for his efforts in addressing issues in the region, called for a collective action in tackling a series of challenges affecting the South East zone.
