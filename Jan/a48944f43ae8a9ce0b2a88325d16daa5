From Ogbonnaya Ndukwe, Aba   All Progressives Grand Alliance (APGA) candidate for the Aba Central constituency of House of Assembly, Matthew Okorie, has decried the deplorable state of infrastructure in Aba, the commercial hub of the state. Okorie noted that despite making laws, legislators have also the responsibility of assisting in the practical improvement of infrastructure of their constituencies, but regretted that this was scarcely obtainable. According to him, many elected legislators shy away from presenting the true position of the developmental needs of their people, but convert funds meant to provide projects for their constituency to personal use, thereby widening the belief that government intentionally denied them of useful infrastructure. He promised to represent Aba Central constituency effectively, if elected, adding that he will work with the executive arm of government to rehabilitate and privatise moribund industries like the Aba Textile Mills, International Glass Industry, Enyimba Hotels, among others, to provide jobs for youths and reposition the economy of the state. He expressed the optimism that the people of the commercial city will vote for APGA, in view of the successes recorded by its candidates that earlier represented Aba North, Aba South and Aba Central constituencies in the Assembly, as well as the late Prestige Ossy, who was in the House of Representatives for the area from 2015, until his death early this year. “APGA was voted for in the entire Aba North and South constituencies, and we even won the governorship seat before it was taken away from us.  “Those representing us at the moment who benefitted from the APGA vision, but later joined other parties, have failed the people and refused to reignite the developmental programmes handed to them, so it’s time, we strip them of the positions of trust and return those that will deliver,” he said.
