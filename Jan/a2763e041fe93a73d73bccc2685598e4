The Atiku-Okowa campaign in Anambra state has boasted of having organic grassroots support and appeal in the state, insisting that Atiku Abubakar and all the candidates of the People’s Democratic Party would win their elections with ease, as it had in previous general elections in the state.  This was disclosed by the Deputy Director, Media and Publicity, Atiku-Okowa Campaign in Anambra State, Uloka Chukwubuikem, on Friday in Awka.  He said nothing would be enough to stop the victory of Atiku Abubakar and the PDP in Anambra State, adding that it’s a tradition for Anambra to always vote PDP at the national level. “In Anambra state, elections have always been between PDP and APGA, but in the end, APGA will take the governorship and majority House of Assembly, while PDP clears all National Assembly seats and wins 98 percent of the votes for the president candidate.  With the open criticism of Governor Soludo towards Peter Obi’s ambition, there’s no doubt that it’s going to be PDP all the way. APGA is a regional and most obviously, a local party; it’s unfit to compete with the PDP in national elections. “Since 1999 until the last general election, the PDP has never lost Anambra State. The grassroots support is still alive, and we will still harness it to deliver victory for the PDP and Atiku-Okowa. Many of our people have begun to let their emotions subside and see reasons to join the queue for an Atiku-Okowa victory in the February 25 election,” he stated.
