From Paul Osuyi, Asaba  General Superintendent of Deeper Christian Life Ministry, William F. Kumuyi, has urged youths to remain focused on God who formed them. The cleric advised youths not to be deformed by the corruption of the world but that they should know their purpose on earth. Kumuyi said lack of focus on God would allow Satan to lure them away from the purpose and plans God have for them. He gave the admonition at a global youth programme, ‘Impact Academy’, with the theme: Wonderfully Made For Excellence, at the weekend, in Asaba, Delta State.  The programme was in continuation of the ongoing Global Crusade with Kumuyi (GCK), tagged: ‘Unforgettable Encounter With the God of Wonders’.  Kumuyi enjoined Christians to be steadfast in studying the word of God so as not to fall victims of the wrong teachings of the world, stressing that an unclean heart leads to unclean actions which eventually become unclean habits. Pastor Kumuyi, who took his text from the book of Genesis, reminded Christians that God gave man dominion right from creation. He, however, said it appears that natural disasters like earthquake, tornadoes among others have made it seem the world is now having dominion over man. The cleric said scientists and researchers are working daily to better understand how some parts of the human body work but have not come to a conclusion in understanding why some persons are quite different from others. The renowned evangelist noted that every man was formed by the inspiration of the Creator, deformed by inventions of corruption but now transformed by the intervention of Jesus Christ. Some participants described the message as timely, especially as most youths have thrown caution to the wind.
