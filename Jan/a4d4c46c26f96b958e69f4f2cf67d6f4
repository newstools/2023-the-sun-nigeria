From Tunde Omolehin, Sokoto  Sokoto State chapter of the All Progressives Congress (APC) has accused Governor Aminu Tambuwal of allowing security to deteriorate in the state. The party also asked the governor to focus on improving security rather than blame the Federal Government.  Addressing journalists in Sokoto, the state chairman,  Sadiq Acida, alleged  the governor seems to be comfortable with the state of insecurity in the state. He claimed the governor was the least qualified to speak about neglecting the plight of communities affected by banditry in the state. Acida said while other state governors have taken leading roles in curbing banditry, the governor has maintained the back seat and deliberately allowed the situation to deteriorate. He said a PDP member of the State House of Assembly was so frustrated by the Governor’s negligence, in spite of several appeals and calls, that he had no option than to decamp to the APC where he and his people have found solace. “On the issue of security, the ranting by Governor Tambuwal has confirmed our suspicion, that he is comfortable with the security situation and he is poised to use it as a campaign tool. Governors in neighbouring states of Kebbi, Zamfara, Katsina, Kaduna, Bauchi and Borno have since shown that leaders can bring about positive developments to complement the Federal Government.”
