A Cameroonian, Lebsey Lebaga, has won the 10th edition of the Future Africa Leaders Foundation organised by The Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International (COFI) in Lagos.  Presenting the award, Ifeoma Chiemeka, chief executive officer, LoveWorld Incorporated, said FALA has recognised the necessity to change Africa’s narrative and the need to contribute immensely to nation building through the Future Africa Leaders Foundation.  “During the programme, young people were mobilised to execute over 2,000,000 humanitarian acts of services, organise 1,302 conferences and summits impacting 81,650,329 families across the continent of Africa.” Lebaga, in her speech, said: “I am so elated and most especially I’m grateful to the founder of the president of Future Africa Leaders Foundation and the director for giving me the opportunity to have an amplified voice amidst the crowd of the number of people applied for this position. This award means so much to me because it directly impacts thousands of people back in Cameroon who look up to me with regards to some of my projects. It is such a great privilege without this award, I will not be able to fund some of the projects that I intend to do. The financial assistance through this award will enable me to attain all my objectives and it will open several doors to meet other people who will be able to fund some of my projects subsequently.”
