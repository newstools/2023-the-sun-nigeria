By Henry Uche A non-governmental organisation, Social Rehabilitation Group (SRG), has said allegations peddled against the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Ahmed Tinubu, are all false. At its inaugural meeting yesterday, the convener/national coordinator of the group, Charles Oludare, warned Nigerians to desist from spreading wrong narratives about the country and its leaders if democracy must be sustainable. Oludare faulted former president Olusegun Obasanjo for endorsing Labour Party candidate, Peter Obi, and cautioned political candidates to stop selling falsehood to Nigerians.  “Some Nigerians said Tinubu was and an incoherent communicator/speaker who commits blunder while making speeches at campaigns grounds and other public places.  “Followers of other political parties said Tinubu creates thugs in Lagos and most parts of Nigeria. They said he has no certificate and that he peddled hard drugs and other forms of unfounded allegations, targeted to discredit him.  “We want to state unequivocally that all these are lies. Absolute lies. The truth speaks for itself. Nigerians know the truth,” he said. Oludare accused Obi of promising what he is not capable of doing. He said Tinubu has all it takes to deliver Nigeria from economic dungeon despite the litany of failures of the APC administration. “Tinubu is the man who can deliver Nigeria from the mess we are in,” he said.  On his part, Chairman of Inter-party Advisory Committee (IPAC), Mobolaji Olusegun, said democracy became necessary and important because of good and interactive system of government required to run a progressive nation. Olusegun said it takes good, dynamic and highly strategic leadership to a have a great and well defined nation with a thriving economy capable of sustaining the people and the nation itself.
