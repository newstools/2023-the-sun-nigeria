The NEYLC described the judgment as commendable, noting that it has gone to reinforce the belief that the judiciary is the ” hope of the common man.” It added that “this judgment has further proved that the judiciary is indeed the last hope of the common man. “The court verdict is not only a landmark one, it is legendary and commendable. “We urge the DSS and its leadership to allow common sense to prevail and obey the court judgment to the letter. “They must, in respect for the judiciary and the nation’s constitution, desist from harassing Dr Emefiele. They must allow him to concentrate on his national assignment and deliver on the lofty reforms of the apex bank,” it stated.
