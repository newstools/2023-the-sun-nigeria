Martina Navratilova has been diagnosed with both throat and breast cancer. The 18-time Grand Slam singles champion, who previously had breast cancer in 2010, will start treatment in New York later this month. Navratilova, 66, said both cancers had been caught at an early stage. “The double whammy is serious, but fixable, and I’m hoping for a favourable outcome,” she said. “It’s going to stink for a while, but I’ll fight with all I have got.” Navratilova noticed an enlarged lymph node in her neck during November’s WTA Finals in Fort Worth, Texas.
