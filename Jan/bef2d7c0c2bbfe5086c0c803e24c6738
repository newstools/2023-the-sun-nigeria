A Yeti Airlines ATR 72 plane with 68 passengers and four crew members on board crashed in Nepal during a domestic flight from the capital, Kathmandu to Pokhara on Sunday. A video posted on social media appears to show the jet flying at low altitude moments before the tragedy.   A rescue team was flown to the crash site on a helicopter, according to the Kathmandu Post. “Responders have already reached there and [are] trying to douse the fire,” local official Gurudutta Dhakal said, as quoted by the media.
