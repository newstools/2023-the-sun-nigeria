From Godwin Tsa, Abuja President of the Court of Appeal (PCA), Justice Monica Dongban-Mensem, has warned members of the election petition tribunals not to be used as weapons to truncate elections. She gave the warning, yesterday, saying the court would not hesitate to deal with anyone attempting to put the judiciary into disrepute. The Court of Appeal is empowered to establish election petition tribunals and have the Registries opened at least seven days before the election. The Registry is saddled with the administrative responsibilities of the Tribunal and is headed by a Secretary who is the Principal Administrative Staff. The jurist spoke at a capacity building workshop for Secretaries and other support staff of the Election Petition Tribunal (EPT), with the theme: “Challenges Arising from Election Petition Tribunal and the Way Forward” in Abuja. While admonishing judges to operate within the umbrella of their conscience and integrity in the discharge of their duties, Justice Dongban-Mensem warned: “Do not see it as an opportunity to make money to enrich yourselves, but rather go there to build your name and your future as it is literally said that a good name is better than silver and gold. Discharge your duties with utmost good faith not be carried away by little advances. Your integrity and that of tribunal and its members and in the public searchlight, you must therefore ensure you are used as weapons to truncate the process. The court will not hesitate to deal with anyone found wanting in this regard.” Justice Dongban- Mensem explained that the training was clearly  in anticipation of the general election coming up in a few weeks from today. She said the theme of the workshop emerged from a pensive  analysis of past experiences that necessitated the need to highlight the various challenges associated with the tribunals and adequately brazen judges up against them.
