From Gyang Bere, Jos Workers at the Industrial Training Fund (ITF) have rejoiced with the Director-General, Sir Joseph N. Ari on his conferment with the title of Kurnajam of Goemai Nation and for emerging as the 2022 Plateau Man of the year. The Director of Public Affairs Department, Mrs Suleyol Fred Chagu, in a press statement in Jos, said the recognitions were truly deserved but not entirely unexpected to the workforce and other people that have worked closely with the DG since he assumed office in 2016. Mrs Chagu said the honours indicated that others outside of the ITF have begun to fully appreciate how the DG has transformed the organisation from one that was incapable of actualizing its mandate to positively impacting hundreds of thousands of Nigerians with skills for employability and entrepreneurship. She noted that as the Kurnajam of the Goemai Nation, (the defender of the Goemai Nation), the DG would bring considerable problem-solving skills to ensure peace and harmony not just in the Goemai Nation but Plateau State in general. The director added that the awards, which came at the beginning of the year, merely heralded similar awards that will follow and would serve as a buoy and encouragement for the DG, as he strives to ensure that as many Nigerians as possible are equipped in line with the policies and objectives of the Federal Government.
