From Olanrewaju Lawal, Birnin Kebbi Emir of Yauri, Muhammad Zayyanu Abdullahi, has commended the Federal Government for bringing the Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission (HYPPADEC) to reality. He stated this at official handing over of a site to contractors for the rehabilitation of Yauri waterworks by the commission which would gulp about N1.6 billion. It is to be fully funded through the Kebbi State Water Board. Abdullahi expressed delight over the project and urged contractors to execute the project according the contract specifications using the local artisans and labour for multiplier effect. He said within the last two years, HYPPADEC has executed a number of projects across Kebbi State that have improved the living standard of affected communities. “I want to thank President Muhammadu Buhari administration for inaugurating the commission and providing an enabling environment for its operations. I am lost of words to express my happiness over this development. “He who gives water gives life. Clean water has been our major challenge in this town and, in a couple of months, I know it will be a thing of the past. So, we thank Mr. President for this,” the emir said. Hydroelectric Power Producing Areas Development Commission Managing Director, Abubakar Yelwa, said the project that is in nine slots would be completed in five months.
