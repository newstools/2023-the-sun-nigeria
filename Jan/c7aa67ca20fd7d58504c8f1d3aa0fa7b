By Monica Iheakam Commonwealth Games silver medalist and Nigerian Record (NR) holder in the Shot Put, Chukwuebuka Enekwechi started his 2023 season with an superlative performance. At the 2023 Larry Wieczorek Invitational on Friday in Iowa City, Enekechi threw an incredible indoor  Personal Best (PB) of 21.20m which currently takes the world lead. Just last month at the 2022 National Sports Festival (NSF) in Asaba, Enekwchi broke a 36-year-old hammer national record throwing a distance of 67.45m to set a new games record. The Larry Wieczorek Invitational hosted colleges as well as athletes from around the world participating in the American Track League’s Hawkeye Pro Classic The reigning African champion  had a series of good throws, with four of his throws going over the 21m mark. His series was 20.47m, 21.20m, 21.04m, 21.08m, 20.61m, and 21.18m, while his previous PB was 21.09m. His mark is now second on the Nigerian all-time indoor list, behind Josh Awotunde’s 21.33m recorded in 2018, and ahead of Stephen Mozia’s 21.18m back in 2016. In his post-meet interview, Enekwechi revealed he is now working with a new coach. “It was a great opener, this is my first meet of the season. I started with a PB, I’m working with a new coach now, new training partners, so I felt the support.” Enekwechi has been Nigeria and Africa’s most consistent Shot Put thrower in the past five years. He has won all continental and national titles available at his disposal, throwing record-breaking times to follow them up.  Now working with a new coach who is one of the best in the world, Enekwechi’s target will be set on lowering his records as the season progresses.
