From Stanley Uzoaru, Owerri Elder statesman, Emmanuel Iwuanyanwu, has urged his people of Ikeduru and Mbaitoli councils of Imo State that came recently on the platform of Mbaike Peoples Assembly (MPA) to return to the zoning formula they established. Iwuanyanwu, who is the grand patron of MPA, while speaking in a meeting of the association at the weekend, pointed out that the revert to the zoning principles will allow equal representation in political positions by the two councils. He also noted that the formula would create opportunity for the youths to vie for political positions. The elder statesman also advised the newly formed association to set up committees to enhance fast development between Ikeduru and Mbaitoli. President General of MPA, Marcillinus Nlemigbo, who corroborated Iwuanyanwu’s advise, urged the assembly to abide by it.  He said: “Iwuanyanwu has been a godfather to many of us, I drew my strength from him, what he has begged from us today will be beneficial to all us.”
