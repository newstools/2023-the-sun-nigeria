A member of the Board of Trustees (BoT) and national caucus member of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prince Benjamin Apugo has denied quitting the ruling party. Following Apugo open endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party and the party’s Governorship candidate in Abia state, an online medium had published a report alleging the Ochiagha Ibeku has quit APC. However, in a telephone interview, Apugo described the report as false, saying he was still a bonafide member of APC. Expressing shock over the report, Apugo said at no time did he grant interview to any reporter from the online medium or any media outlet for that matter, to discuss his stay or otherwise in APC. “The report is totally false, I remain a BoT and national caucus member of APC, therefore, I’m still a bonafide member of the party. “I never granted interview to any reporter about my membership or otherwise of APC and wondered the source of information of the reporter”. The Ochiagha Ibeku said for him to have made public his preference in the coming elections, does not mean he has left APC, saying as a foundation member, he would not leave APC for anybody. He urged journalists in the country to always cross check their facts before publication as not to mislead the public.
